Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise (RE; loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, RE mitigates muscle loss. Resistance exercise training (RET)–induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a product of external (e.g., RE programming, diet, some supplements) and internal variables (e.g., mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells activity). RE is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite considerable research on the impact of external variables on RET and hypertrophy, internal variables (i.e., inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus, identifying the key internal skeletal muscle–derived variables that mediate the translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional decline, and promoting physical mobility. We provide up-to-date, evidence-based perspectives of the mechanisms regulating RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.Key Words:SKELETAL MUSCLE, HYPERTROPHY, RESISTANCE EXERCISE, PROTEIN SYNTHESIS, ANABOLIC MECHANISMSSkeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function, athletic performance, and metabolic health, and low muscle mass is associated with greater mortality in healthy adults and adults with comorbidities (1). The regulation of skeletal muscle mass is influenced by several variables that can broadly be categorized into external or internal system variables. Resistance exercise training (RET) is the most potent nonpharmacological external means of increasing skeletal muscle mass (2) and is an external system variable. In contrast, internal variables are inherent systemic or, more often, local (within the muscle) biological processes that mechanistically underpin hypertrophy in response to external stimuli like RET (Fig.1). An important question is to what extent manipulation of external variables influences internal variable responses to affect the outcome—hypertrophy. In our view, identifying the key skeletal muscle molecular targets activated by resistance exercise (RE) that, with repetition, will underpin RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is critical.FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabThe formulation of external vs internal variables for skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

    "content": "This systematic review with meta-analysis grouped studies investigating the influence of resistance training proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy into three broad themes based on the definition of set failure used (and therefore the specific research question being examined), to improve the validity of the meta-analyses.Based on the limited available literature, our main findings show (i) no evidence to support that resistance training performed to momentary muscular failure is superior to non-failure resistance training, (ii) that higher velocity loss thresholds, and thus, theoretically closer proximities-to-failure, elicit greater muscle hypertrophy in a non-linear manner and (iii) no moderating effect of either volume load or relative load on muscle hypertrophy when resistance training was performed using any definition of set failure versus non-failure.These findings provide evidence for a potential non-linear relationship between proximity-to-failure and muscle hypertrophy, but current set termination methods used during non-failure resistance training conditions limit insight into the actual proximity-to-failure achieved and pose a challenge for deriving practical recommendations for manipulating resistance training proximity-to-failure to achieve desired outcomes.

IGF-1 increases skeletal muscle protein synthesis via PI3K/Akt/mTOR and PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathways. PI3K/Akt can also inhibit FoxOs and suppress transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-mediated protein degradation. Autophagy is likely inhibited by IGF-1 via mTOR and FoxO signaling, although the contribution of autophagy regulation in IGF-1-mediated inhibition of skeletal muscle atrophy remains to be determined. Evidence has suggested that IGF-1/Akt can inhibit muscle atrophy-inducing cytokine and myostatin signaling via inhibition of the NF-κΒ and Smad pathways, respectively. Several miRNAs have been found to regulate IGF-1 signaling in skeletal muscle, and these miRs are likely regulated in different pathological conditions and contribute to the development of muscle atrophy. IGF-1 also potentiates skeletal muscle regeneration via activation of skeletal muscle stem (satellite) cells, which may contribute to muscle hypertrophy and/or inhibit atrophy. Importantly, IGF-1 levels and IGF-1R downstream signaling are suppressed in many chronic disease conditions and likely result in muscle atrophy via the combined effects of altered protein synthesis, UPS activity, autophagy, and muscle regeneration.Keywords:insulin-like growth factor-1, skeletal muscle, hypertrophy, atrophy, cachexia, muscle regeneration, autophagy1. IntroductionStudies in various models in cell culture, animals, and humans have evaluated cytokines and growth factors that can regulate muscle growth. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one of the best-characterized growth factors, and it has been shown to modulate muscle size and play a critical role in regulating muscle function. IGF-1 is thought to mediate many of the beneficial outcomes of physical activity [1,2]. In a study analyzing healthy young subjects, circulating IGF-1 levels were negatively associated with body fat, body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol and positively associated with aerobic fitness and muscular endurance parameters (VO2peak, sit-ups, push-ups, and repetitive squats) [3]. In contrast, lower IGF-1 levels were associated with various pathological conditions including chronic diseases, inflammation, and malnutrition [4,5]. Since skeletal muscle cells, or myofibers, are postmitotic, their size is determined by a balance between synthesis of new proteins and degradation of old proteins. Under physiological conditions, the rates of protein synthesis and degradation are balanced and the myofiber size is maintained. In cachectic conditions, on the contrary, myofiber protein degradation is accelerated and protein synthesis rate is suppressed, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue. IGF-1 can regulate both protein synthesis and degradation pathways, and changes in IGF-1 signaling in skeletal muscle can greatly affect myofiber size and function. This review summarizes and discusses different aspects of IGF-1-mediated protein synthetic and degradation pathways in skeletal muscle and its potential application to therapies to treat patients with reduced skeletal muscle function. The signaling pathways downstream of IGF-1 discussed in the following sections are summarized inFigure 1.Figure 1.Open in a new tabIGF-1 signaling pathways. In the figure, the sig"

Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the processes of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB), both of which are sensitive to external loading and aminoacidemia. Hyperaminoacidemia results in a robust but transient increase in rates of MPS and a mild suppression of MPB. Resistance exercise potentiates the aminoacidemia-induced rise in MPS that, when repeated over time, results in gradual radial growth of skeletal muscle (i.e., hypertrophy). Factors that affect MPS include both quantity and composition of the amino acid source. Specifically, MPS is stimulated in a dose-responsive manner and the primary amino acid agonist of this process is leucine. MPB also appears to be regulated in part by protein intake, which can exert a suppressive effect on MPB. At high protein doses the suppression of MPB may interfere with skeletal muscle adaptation following resistance exercise. In this review, we examine recent advancements in our understanding of how protein ingestion impacts skeletal muscle growth following resistance exercise in young adults during energy balance and energy restriction. We also provide practical recommendations for exercisers who wish to maximize the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle during resistance exercise training.Keywords:skeletal muscle, protein turnover, resistance exercise, muscle hypertrophy, energy balance, energy restriction, amino acids1. IntroductionMaintaining skeletal muscle mass throughout the lifespan is critical for the preservation of metabolic health and independent locomotion. While central to the production of contractile force, skeletal muscle also serves as the primary site of postprandial glucose disposal [1] and is the largest contributor to resting energy expenditure [2]. In addition to the health-centric importance of maintaining skeletal muscle there is also great interest, particularly within the athletic community, in enhancing the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to exercise training (i.e., improved force production and increasing muscle size: hypertrophy) with the aim of maximizing physical performance in competitive events. Thus, strategies to augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy and promote optimal remodeling and reconditioning of skeletal muscle following exercise training is an intense area of scientific inquiry with ramifications in both the clinical and athletic settings.There is now a wealth of studies that have characterized the response of skeletal muscle to changes in nutritional and contractile stimuli. What these studies have shown is that the size of skeletal muscle is dependent upon the kinetic processes of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) a"

The purpose of this review is to provide some further dialogue regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the synergist ablation model. Specifically, we highlight that the robustness of the model overshadows surgical limitations. We also compare the transcriptomic responses to synergist ablation in mice and resistance exercise in humans to identify common pathways. We conclude that “cell growth is cell growth” and that the mechanisms available to cells to accumulate biomass and increase in size are similar across cell types and independent of the rate of growth.INTRODUCTIONWe applaud Roberts et al. (1) on their insightful review response to our review article “The Utility of the Rodent Synergist Ablation Model in Identifying Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy” (2). The authors discussed important limitations of the synergist ablation (SA) model. Although we agree with many of the points raised, the purpose of this response is to provide some further dialogue and discourse regarding some of the stated disadvantages of the rodent SA model.CELL GROWTH IS CELL GROWTHIn their review response, Roberts et al. (1) suggest that SA generates “an unparalleled growth stimulus unlike any other model across species.” Although we agree with the notion that SA produces supra-physiological growth in skeletal muscle, we propose the idea that many of the mechanisms available to a cell to accumulate biomass and increase in size are similar, regardless of the rate of this growth or even the cell type. For example, the target of rapamycin (TOR) system is a key regulator of cell growth conserved between yeast,Caenorhabditis elegans,Drosophila, and mammals (3). Signaling via the mammalian TOR (mTOR) has been implicated in mechanical overload (MOV)-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy, which was first identified using the SA model, before being validated in human resistance exercise studies, as we discuss in the initial review. Beyond its role in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, mTOR signaling is implicated in robust pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cancer cell growth (4). To this end, accumulating evidence suggests that skeletal muscle hypertrophy rewires cellular metabolism to generate biomass similar to cancer cells. This metabolic reprogramming is characteriz"

Upon activation, MuSCs exhibit distinct modes of division: symmetric division, facilitating either self-renewal or differentiation, and asymmetric division, which dictates divergent cellular fates. This review explores the nuanced dynamics of MuSC division and the molecular mechanisms governing this behavior. Furthermore, it introduces a novel phenomenon observed in a subset of MuSCs under hypertrophic stimuli termed division-independent differentiation. Insights into the underlying mechanisms driving this process are discussed, alongside its broader implications for muscle physiology.Keywords:differentiation, division patterns, division-independent differentiation, hypertrophy, muscle stem cells, proliferationIntroductionSkeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue that adapts continuously to functional demands, a process that often requires resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs), commonly known as satellite cells [1–3]. MuSC were originally named satellite cells because they are located on the periphery of muscle fibers, just beneath the basal lamina and adjacent to the sarcolemma. First identified by Alexander Mauro and Bernard Katz in 1961, MuSCs are quiescent under homeostatic conditions [4,5]. In response to muscle injury, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into myoblasts; however, depending on the degree of damage, myoblasts can fuse to one another to form myotubes or fuse with damaged muscle fibers to restore muscle structure and function [6,7]. MuSCs are now recognized as the cellular basis for the remarkable regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle and are also thought to be necessary for maintaining muscle homeostasis throughout an organism's life. Secondary to muscle regeneration, MuSCs have also been shown to become activated, replicate, differentiate and then fuse to myofibers in response to a hypertrophic stimulus, resulting in an increase in myonuclear abundance [8–12]. In contrast with the well-characterized process of muscle regeneration, the dynamics of MuSCs behavior during muscle hypertrophy remain"

A noticeable aspect of skeletal muscle biology is the drastic cell–cell communication changes that occur in multiple scenarios. The process of recovering from an injury, which is known as regeneration, has been relatively well investigated. However, the cellular interplay that occurs in response to mechanical loading, such as during resistance training, is poorly understood compared to regeneration. During muscle regeneration, muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) rebuild multinuclear myofibers through a stepwise process of proliferation, differentiation, fusion, and maturation, whereas during mechanical loading-dependent muscle hypertrophy, MuSCs do not undergo such stepwise processes (except in rare injuries) because the nuclei of MuSCs become directly incorporated into the mature myonuclei. In this review, six specific examples of such differences in MuSC dynamics between regeneration and hypertrophy processes are discussed.Keywords:Muscle regeneration, Hypertrophy, Muscle satellite cells, Myonuclei, DifferentiationBackgroundSkeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue that presents excellent regenerative ability and plasticity in response to external and internal changes, and both processes rely on myogenic-committed cells that reside in skeletal muscle, which are known as muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) [1–4]. MuSCs remain in a quiescent state under steady conditions [5] but start proliferating in response to damage or skeletal muscle loading. MuSC behavior is affected by multiple cell types, including myofibers, immune cells, and interstitial cells, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors (FAPs: fibro/adipogenic progenitors) (Figs.1and2) [6–11]. Compared to the process of muscle regeneration, the mechanism regulating MuSC dynamics under muscle loading (such as a resistance training) has not been well investigated. However, recent studies have analyzed the mechanisms underlying MuSC proliferation and cell–cell communication in loaded muscles [9,10,12,13]. We briefly summarize the process of muscle regeneration and load-dependent muscle hypertrophy according to key factors underlying MuSC behaviors and discuss six differences in MuSC dynamics and cell–cell interactions between the regeneration and hypertrophy processes.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabProcess of skeletal mus"

Both muscle regeneration and hypertrophy rely on the interactions between muscle stem cells and their neighborhood, which include inflammatory cells, and particularly macrophages. This review first summarizes the role of macrophages in muscle regeneration in various animal models of injury and in response to exercise‐induced muscle damage in humans. Then, the potential contribution of macrophages to skeletal muscle hypertrophy is discussed on the basis of both animal and human experiments. We also present a brief comparative analysis of the role of macrophages during muscle regeneration versus hypertrophy. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge on the impact of different immunomodulatory strategies, such as heat therapy, cooling, massage, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and resolvins, on skeletal muscle regeneration and their potential impact on muscle hypertrophy.Macrophage dynamics during muscle regeneration versus hypertrophy.1. INTRODUCTIONAdult skeletal muscle is a highly plastic organ. Muscle remodels, i.e. adapts to the physical demand, such as during hypertrophy, and regenerates after a damage. The two processes involve different mechanisms (Fukada et al.,2022). Muscle remodeling mainly relies on adaptation of the myofibers while regeneration relies on muscle stem cells (aka satellite cells, MuSCs) that implement adult myogenesis. MuSCs are absolutely required for muscle regeneration (Lepper et al.,2011; Murphy et al.,2011; Sambasivan et al.,2011), but their involvement in remodeling induced by (or consecutive to) skeletal muscle hypertrophy remains a matter of debate (Egner et al.,2016; McCarthy et al.,2011). However, in both situations, MuSCs develop interactions with their neighborhood, which includes inflammatory cells, and particularly macrophages.Macrophages are known for a long time to be involved in post‐injury skeletal muscle regeneration, where they play very important trophic roles for MuSCs and other cells in the muscle tissue. By extension, macrophages have been investigated in other conditions where muscle remodeling takes place, such as hypertrophy, but the knowledge on their biological functions is far less advanced in that context, both in animal models and human. Here we provide a brief overview on how macrophages regulate muscle regeneration through their interactions with various cell types (references to reviews for "

    "content": "In addition to training loads, training volume, and rest intervals, movement tempo should be controlled and considered when planning and executing resistance-training programs.Neither isolated slow nor fast movement tempos are more effective for muscle hypertrophy, but it seems that the most favorable is a combination of slower eccentric movements, paired with faster concentric movements.Slower movement tempos require decreased external load, yet when paired with a greater time under tension, can create an adequate stimulus to induce hypertrophy and strength gains.Faster concentric speeds are often thought to provide a better stimulus for neural adaptations and greater strength gains, but increasing the eccentric time under tension may help promote muscular hypertrophy, indirectly affecting strength without adversely affecting neural adaptations.

Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that macrophages could also present two major subsets during tissue healing: proliferative macrophages (M1-like), which are responsible for increasing myogenic cell proliferation, and restorative macrophages (M2-like), which are involved in the end of the mature muscle myogenesis. The participation and characterization of these macrophage subsets are critical during myogenesis to understand the inflammatory role of macrophages during muscle recovery and to create supportive strategies that can improve mass muscle maintenance. Indeed, most of our knowledge about macrophage subsets comes from skeletal muscle damage protocols, and we still do not know how these subsets can contribute to skeletal muscle adaptation. Thus, this narrative review aims to collect and discuss studies demonstrating the involvement of different macrophage subsets during the skeletal muscle damage/regeneration process, showcasing an essential role of these macrophage subsets during muscle adaptation induced by acute and chronic exercise programs.INTRODUCTIONTwo main types of cells constitute the immunological system: lymphoid and myeloid; both have roots in the bone marrow through cellular functions that can differ following maturation (1,2). Most lymphoid and myeloid cells carry the same biological signature throughout life (e.g., receptors, encoded genes), essential for lineage tracing (3,4).Considering monocyte/macrophage lineage, this signature is more evident because these cells present highly functional plasticity depending on environmental factors; for instance, during the damage process, clearing of the muscle debris influences macrophages to switch polarization from proinflammatory (M1-like) to reparative anti-inflammatory (M2-like), as part of a process that is essential for proper muscle repair (5–9). Thus, to understand the role of these distinct macrophage subsets during muscle disturbances, this review will start with a brief overview of skeletal muscle organization.Skeletal muscle comprises several long and multinuclear fibers, surrounded by a tissue layer connected with a web of vessels and innervated by motor neurons (10,11). This structural organization allows the exchange of metabolic nutrients between blood and tissue and provides an adequate site for immune tissue monitoring (12–14). Satellite cells, a multipotent muscle stem cell, are located in the surrounding fibers within the basal lamina and plasma membrane (12,15). Satellite cells are critical for adult skeletal muscle regeneration and required for myogenesis (12,13,16).Myogenesis is how skeletal muscles form new myofibers (12,15,17). At homeostasis, satellite cells remain quiescent (13,15,16), whereas during myogenesis, coordinated activation of several muscle-specific cells occurs, synchronized with differential genetic markers (13,18). After activation, the satellite cells start prolife"

We report, for the first time in humans, genome-wide DNA methylation (850,000 CpGs) and gene expression analysis after muscle hypertrophy (loading), return of muscle mass to baseline (unloading), followed by later hypertrophy (reloading). We discovered increased frequency of hypomethylation across the genome after reloading (18,816 CpGs) versus earlier loading (9,153 CpG sites). We also identified AXIN1, GRIK2, CAMK4, TRAF1 as hypomethylated genes with enhanced expression after loading that maintained their hypomethylated status even during unloading where muscle mass returned to control levels, indicating a memory of these genes methylation signatures following earlier hypertrophy. Further, UBR5, RPL35a, HEG1, PLA2G16, SETD3 displayed hypomethylation and enhanced gene expression following loading, and demonstrated the largest increases in hypomethylation, gene expression and "

Therefore, we were interested in understanding exercise-induced hypertrophy across different muscles in older individuals. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the available information on muscle-specific hypertrophy responses to exercise training with aging (≥60 yr). In total, 6,018 peer-reviewed publications were reviewed for inclusion [e.g., supervised resistance (RE) or aerobic (AE) exercise training; MRI, CT, or ultrasound-determined muscle size], resulting in 1,417 individuals from 68 studies (RE:n= 1,254; AE:n= 163). Data were divided across age (60–69, 70–79, 80–89, and ≥90 yr) and duration (≤9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, and ≥25 wk), with the majority coming from the sexa- and septuagenarians (n= 1,335, 94%) and 10–14 wk of training (n= 806, 57%). The number of muscle groups (RE: 7, AE: 8) and subcomponent muscles (RE: 10, AE: 16) was a low representation of the whole body musculature, with 79% of the data (n= 1,113) coming from the quadriceps. The 10–14 wk responses showed a range of unique muscle-specific hypertrophy and atrophy (RE: 60–69 yr: 2%–14% across 6 muscles; 70–79 yr: 1%–12% across 9 muscles; AE: 70–79 yr: −6% to +9% across 22 muscles). The large quadriceps-only resistance exercise training dataset (60–79 yr) showed that no additional hypertrophy was observed with increased training repetitions (i.e., dose) and that men and women elicited an equivalent hypertrophic training response. The optimal exercise training mode(s) and dose(s) for all of the skeletal muscles of sexa-, septa-, octo-, and nonagenarian women and men are far from being elucidated based on the current scientific literature.INTRODUCTIONThere is evidence that muscles atrophy at different rates as humans age (1). Considering that exercise has a powerful impact on offsetting or reversing age-related muscle atrophy (2–13), an important follow-up question to these summary findings is whether exercise responsiveness is muscle-specific. The answer to this question has implications for exercise protocol development and guidelines for older women and men to attenuate or reverse the decline in aging skeletal muscle health and improve overall quality of life.There is strong evidence for muscle-specific exercise responsiveness from the literature on human microgravity exposure, where muscle atrophy approaches, and in some cases exceeds, the magnitude observed with aging. For example, muscles of the lower "

Outside the muscle fiber, however, is a diversity of mononuclear cell types that reside in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These muscle-resident cells are exercise-responsive and produce the scaffolding for successful myofibrillar growth. Without proper remodeling and maintenance of this ECM scaffolding, the ability to mount an appropriate response to resistance training in adult muscles is severely hindered. Complex cellular choreography takes place in muscles following a loading stimulus. These interactions have been recently revealed by single-cell explorations into muscle adaptation with loading. The intricate ballet of ECM remodeling involves collagen production from fibrogenic cells and ECM modifying signals initiated by satellite cells, immune cells, and the muscle fibers themselves. The acellular collagen-rich ECM is also a mechanical signal-transducer and rich repository of growth factors that may directly influence muscle fiber hypertrophy once liberated. Collectively, high levels of collagen expression, deposition, and turnover characterize a well-trained muscle phenotype. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most recent evidence for how the ECM and its cellular components affect loading-induced muscle hypertrophy. We also address how the muscle fiber may directly take part in ECM remodeling, "

A tight relationship between muscle hypertrophy, acute increases in protein balance, and the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was demonstrated 15 years ago. Since then, our understanding of the signals that regulate load-induced hypertrophy has evolved considerably. For example, we now know that mechanical load activates mTORC1 in the same way as growth factors, by moving TSC2 (a primary inhibitor of mTORC1) away from its target (the mTORC activator) Rheb. However, the kinase that phosphorylates and moves TSC2 is different in the two processes. Similarly, we have learned that a distinct pathway exists whereby amino acids activate mTORC1 by moving it to Rheb. While mTORC1 remains at the forefront of load-induced hypertrophy, the importance of other pathways that regulate muscle mass are becoming clearer. Myostatin, is best known for its control of developmental muscle size. However, new mechanisms to explain how loading regulates this process are suggesting that it could play an important role in hypertrophic muscle growth as well. Lastly, new mechanisms are highlighted for how β2 receptor agonists could be involved in load-induced muscle growth and why these agents are being developed as non-exercise-based therapies for muscle atrophy. Overall, the results highlight how studying the mechanism of load-induced skeletal muscle mass is leading the development of pharmaceutical interventions to promote muscle growth in those unwilling or unable to perform resistance exercise.Skeletal muscle mass: a context for understanding its regulationThe regulation of tissue size is dictated by the balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation [1]. More specifically, it is the balance of the synthesis and degradation of functional and structural proteins within the cell that determines tissue size. Consequently, in muscle a net positive or net negative myofibrillar protein balance results in hypertrophy or atrophy, respectively. In healthy adults, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis fluctuate between periods of net positive (after protein feeding) and net negative (fasting) balance, such that the change in muscle mass over time is, broadly speaking, very small [2]. While both rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis and breakdown fluctuate during anabolic and catabolic conditions, using our current methods the rate of protein synthesis appears more dynamic than that of protein breakdown, ultimately suggesting skeletal muscle mass is primarily dictated by the regulation of muscle protein synthesis [3]. There is also a fallacy in the field that decreasing the rate of degradation would always increase muscle mass. In some cases this is true [4,5]. However, It is now clear that some forms of protein degradation actually are necessary to drive protein synthesis and improve both muscle size and quality [6,7].Skeletal muscle is a plastic tissue that rapidly adapts to its mechanical environment [8]. Increased load across a muscle, such as from strength (resistance) exercise or heavy work, results in a compensatory increase in muscle size and strength. This increase in size occurs largely from the growth of existing cells (hypertrophy) rather than an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) [9]. Mechanical loading also results in strong adaptive responses in a host of other tissues including bone [10], tendon [11] and the extracellular matrix in muscle [12], protecting these tissues against future injury. Conversely, tissue atrophy occurs with the introduction of catabolic stimuli including dietary protein withdrawal [13], mechanical unloading [14,15] or during disease/injury states [16].

Indeed, matricellular proteins serve a key role as communication vehicles that facilitate the propagation of signaling stimuli required for muscle adaptation to environmental challenges. We found that the matricellular protein cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is induced during a time course of overload-driven skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice. To elucidate the role of CCN2 in mediating the hypertrophic response, we utilized genetically engineered mouse models for myofiber-specific CCN2 gain- and loss-of-function and then examined their response to mechanical stimuli through muscle overload. Interestingly, myofiber-specific deletion of CCN2 blunted muscle’s hypertrophic response to overload without interfering with ECM deposition. On the other hand, when in excess through transgenic CCN2 overexpression, CCN2 was efficient in promoting overload-induced aberrant ECM accumulation without affecting myofiber growth. Altogether, our genetic approaches highlighted independent ECM and myofiber stress adaptation responses, and positioned CCN2 as a central mediator of both. Mechanistically, CCN2 acts by regulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediated transduction of overload-induced extracellular signals, including interleukin 6 (IL6), and their regulatory impact on global protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Overall, our study highlights the contribution of muscle-derived extracellular matrix factor CCN2 for proper hypertrophic muscle growth.Keywords:CCN2, CTGF, muscle, fibrosis, hypertrophyIntroductionThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is key to coordinating cellular responses that result following stress and challenges that perturb tissue homeostasis. Remodeling of the ECM is achieved through changes in the composition and amount of secreted proteins that serve both structural and signaling roles [1–4]. Understanding how ECM remodeling is regulated and how it impacts organ function is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating adaptation to stress.In skeletal muscle, the ECM serves an ess"

Combining genetic models with mechanical muscle loading enables identification of specific factors involved in the hypertrophic response as well as the ability to test the requirement of those factors for adaptation, thereby informing performance and therapeutic interventions. Until recently, approaches for inducing mechanically mediated muscle hypertrophy (i.e., resistance-training analogs) have been limited and considered “nontranslatable” to humans. This mini-review outlines recent translational advances in loading-mediated strategies for inducing muscle hypertrophy in mice, and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The skeletal muscle field is poised for new breakthroughs in understanding mechanisms regulating load-induced muscle growth given the numerous murine tools that have very recently been described.INTRODUCTIONKey regulators of muscle mass discovered using genetic or pharmacological gain- and loss-of function approaches in mice are often subsequently shown to be altered by loading in humans (i.e., acute resistance exercise and/or training), likely contributing to muscle hypertrophy (5,12,38,39,48,49). The development of murine muscle-specific Cre/Lox and Tet-On technologies over the last decade now allows for unprecedented insight into the modifiable factors affecting muscle growth in vivo (24,37,40). Moving beyond association and correlation, the utility of mouse models for mechanistically understanding skeletal muscle mass regulation is inarguable and invaluable (55).To identify targets associated with load-mediated muscle hypertrophy, as well as test the requirement of those targets for growth in vivo, a surgical model of overload in mice has historically been the standard (18,54). This method, termed synergist ablation, involves the excision of one large muscle or a group of muscles to elicit a compensatory growth response from a smaller muscle through ambulation. Most often, the tibialis anterior (dorsiflexor) or gastrocnemius/soleus complex (plantarflexors) are partially or completely removed to overload the extensor digitorum longus or plantaris, respectively.

Nonetheless, its applicability to counteract the age-related skeletal muscle decay at a cellular level, is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of BFRRE on muscle fiber morphology, integrated muscle protein synthesis, muscle stem cells (MuSCs), myonuclear content, and muscle functional capacity in healthy older individuals. Twenty-three participants with a mean age of 66 yr (56–75 yr) were randomized to 6 wk of supervised BFRRE (3 sessions per week) or non-exercise control (CON). Biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis before and after the intervention. Immunofluorescent microscopy was utilized to assess muscle fiber type-specific cross-sectional area (CSA) as well as MuSC and myonuclear content. Deuterium oxide was orally administered throughout the intervention period, enabling assessment of integrated myofibrillar and connective tissue protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR). BFRRE produced uniform ∼20% increases in the fiber CS"

This ability is conferred by the presence of myogenic stem cells called satellite cells. In response to stimuli such as injury or exercise, these cells become activated and express myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), i.e., transcription factors of the myogenic lineage including Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, and Mrf4 to proliferate and differentiate into myofibers. The MRF family of proteins controls the transcription of important muscle-specific proteins such as myosin heavy chain and muscle creatine kinase. Different growth factors are secreted during muscle repair among which insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are the only ones that promote both muscle cell proliferation and differentiation and that play a key role in muscle regeneration and hypertrophy. Different isoforms of IGFs are expressed during muscle repair: IGF-IEa, IGF-IEb, or IGF-IEc (also known as mechano growth factor, MGF) and IGF-II. MGF is expressed first and is observed in satellite cells and in proliferating myoblasts whereas IGF-Ia and IGF-II expression occurs at the state of muscle fiber formation. Interestingly, several studies report the induction of MRFs in response to IGFs stimulation. Inversely, IGFs expression may also be regulated by MRFs. Various mechanisms are proposed to support these interactions. In this review, we describe the general process of muscle hypertrophy and regeneration and decipher the interactions between the two groups of factors involved in the process.Keywords:Regeneration, IGF, MyoD, Myogenin, Myogenesis, HypertrophyIntroductionAbout one-half of our body mass is made up skeletal muscle. Besides its obvious role in locomotor activity and postural behavior, skeletal muscle also functions as a metabolic regulator, for example by storing glycogen. Loss of muscle tissue observed in aging or in degenerative muscle diseases therefore alters physical abilities and leads to metabolic problems such as insulin resistance or osteoporosis. This constitutes a major public-health problem.Adult muscle consists of multinucleated myofibers that can undergo changes in size (atrophy/hypertrophy) and type (slow-contracting, fatigue-resistant type/fast-contracting, fatigable type). Due to its daily mechanical work, muscle undergoes small tears and minor lesions. This leads to a slow turnover of constituent fibers, replacing no more than 1–2 % of myonuclei per week [1]. In normal conditions, adult skeletal muscle is therefore a stable tissue. However, in response to severe injury due to a direct trauma, to an extensive physical activity or to a genetic muscle disease, skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to regenerate itself, preventing loss of muscle mass and/or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of muscle diseases. This is due to the presence of quiescent satellite cells, which are mononucleated cells localized in a niche constituted by the sarcolemma of the adjacent muscle fiber and the basal lamina. The initial phase of muscle repair is characterized by necrosis of damaged fibers and activation of an inflammatory response. Then, quiescent satellite cells reenter the cell cycle and proliferate to renew the quiescent satellite cell pool or to differentiate in new myofibers. The final phase of regeneration consists of a maturation of newly formed myofibers and in a remodeling of regenerated muscle.Different factors play critical roles in skeletal muscle regeneration. Among them, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are critical for muscle repair. MRF family proteins constitute the key factors that determine the progression of satellite cell activation during myogenesis and muscle regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which the expression and activity of these factors are regulated during the processes are not completely clarified. Specifically, it is not clear whether the IGF pathway acts upstream/dow"

Although the most common cause of extraocular muscle enlargement is thyroid eye disease, a range of other inflammatory, infective, neoplastic, and vascular conditions can alter the size and shape of the extraocular muscles. Imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging plays an essential role in the workup of these conditions. This article provides an image-rich review of the wide range of pathology that can cause enlargement of the extraocular muscles.Keywords:Extraocular muscle, Computed tomography, Magnetic resonance imaging, OrbitIntroductionExtraocular muscle enlargement (EOME) can occur secondary to an array of inflammatory, neoplastic, infective or vascular conditions. Orbital imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an essential role in the workup of these conditions. High-resolution orbital MRI has allowed for a more detailed characterisation of orbital disease. Recognising the pattern of muscle involvement along with accompanying orbital signs can help to narrow the differential diagnosis, or even enable a single diagnosis. This review focuses on the radiological findings associated with pathology that cause extraocular muscle enlargement.Thyroid eye diseaseThyroid eye disease (TED) is the most common inflammatory myopathy affecting the extraocular muscles. Radiologically, it presents with bilateral enlargement of the muscle belly with relative sparing of the anterior tendon. Traditionally, muscles are said to be involved in the following order: inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus and lateral rectus (Fig.1A) [1]. However, it is now being recognised that superior muscle complex involvement is also very frequent, possibly the most common [2,3]. Furthermore, isolated levator muscle enlargement can also occur (Fig.1B) and is associated with upper eyelid retraction [2–4]. Both superior and inferior oblique involvement has also been recognised and should be assessed on imaging (Fig.1C,D) [5,6].Fig. 1.Open in a new tabThyroid eye disease. Coronal CT (A) of the orbit demonstrating a ‘typical’ case of TED with bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement of the inferior rectus, medial rectus and superior muscle group.

Here, we report that the SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, the primary molecular machinery that degrades misfolded proteins in the ER, is vital to maintain postnatal muscle growth and systemic energy balance. Myocyte-specific SEL1L deletion blunts the hypertrophic phase of muscle growth, resulting in a net zero gain of muscle mass during this developmental period and a 30% reduction in overall body growth. In addition, myocyte-specific SEL1L deletion triggered a systemic reprogramming of metabolism characterized by improved glucose sensitivity, enhanced beigeing of adipocytes, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. These effects were partially mediated by the upregulation of the myokine FGF21. These findings highlight the pivotal role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD activity in skeletal myocytes for postnatal muscle growth, and its physiological integration in maintaining whole-body energy balance.Keywords:Cell Biology, Muscle BiologyKeywords:Cell stress, Protein misfolding, Skeletal muscleIntroductionSkeletal muscle is not only indispensable for physical movement, but also plays a major role in regulating whole-body energy and"

A main factor determining the rate of protein synthesis is ribosome abundance or translational capacity. The production of ribosomes is a primary determinant of translational capacity. Based on studies from our laboratory, we propose the novel hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is necessary for skeletal muscle hypertrophy.Keywords:skeletal muscle, hypertrophy, ribosome, translational capacity, protein synthesisIntroductionAdult skeletal muscle as an organ is amazingly plastic. Muscle robustly changes its size, composition and metabolic profile in order to optimally adapt to environmental and physiological demands (4). In response to resistance exercise training, muscle progressively accumulates protein mass leading to hypertrophy of individual myofibers. Conversely, under chronic conditions of energy deprivation, unloading, and/or disease, muscle undergoes a relatively rapid atrophy resulting from a loss in myofiber cross-sectional area. A critical determinant of muscle mass is the ratio of protein synthesis to protein breakdown; however, commitment to protein synthesis may be the preferred target of regulation in all but emergency situations (22).Protein synthesis does not happen without ribosomes, which are nature’s nano machines that convert mRNA genetic code into polypeptide chains. Changes to these protein factories during periods of muscle growth are key to understanding the mechanisms of skeletal muscle plasticity. Specifically, during muscle hypertrophy, the amount of protein synthesis per unit RNA (translation efficiency) and the total ribosomal content (translation capacity) both increase within muscle fibers (2,20). As one would imagine, these two processes are intimately connected and, as has been reported in the heart, there is an emerging recognition that the initial increase in translational efficiency in response to a growth stimulus is required for the subsequent increase in translational capacity that ultimately leads to the protein accretion that underlies skeletal muscle hypertrophy (16).In this review, we first provide a brief description of the ribosome and the regulation of ribosome biogenesis, followed by a discussion of our work supporting the main thesis and then finish with a review of studies from other investigators in the field that provide additional compelling evidence in support of our hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is necessary for skeletal muscle hypertrophy.Ribosome BiogenesisThe functionally mature human ribosome (80S) is a 4.3 megadalton ribonucleoprotein complex composed of two subunits. The large (60S) subunit contains three (28S, 5S, and 5.8S) ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 47 ribosomal proteins (RPLs). The small (40S) subunit contains one (18S) rRNA molecule and 33 ribosomal proteins (RPSs). Three of the four rRNA molecules (28S, 5.8S, and 18S) are transcribed together as a single precursor rRNA molecule called the 47S pre-rRNA. The 47S pre-rRNA is transcribed by the dedicated RNA polymerase I (Pol I) from ribosomal DNA sequences (rDNA). The human genome contains hundreds of copies of tandem repeats of rDNA sequences distributed across five chromosomes. The rDNA clusters are organized into characteristic regions within the nucleus known as the nucleolus (12).Cleavage of the 47S pre-rRNA by processing factors and small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) leads to the formation of"

The mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy due to mechanical overload have been thoroughly studied. Remarkably, our understanding of many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate hypertrophic growth were first identified using the rodent synergist ablation (SA) model and subsequently corroborated in human resistance exercise training studies. To demonstrate the utility of the SA model, we briefly summarize the hypertrophic mechanisms identified using the model and the following translation of these mechanism to human skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance exercise training.INTRODUCTIONIn 1967, Alfred Goldberg first described a model of rodent hypertrophy where the gastrocnemius tendon was transected (tenotomy) to induce compensatory hypertrophy of the synergistic muscles (i.e., soleus and plantaris) by mechanical overload (MOV) (1,2). Since the initial model, different surgical approaches have been used to induce mechanical loading of the plantaris and soleus muscles (Fig. 1). Nearly 60 years later, this model, now aptly coined synergist ablation (SA), has been widely used in the exercise physiology field to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of skeletal muscle hypertrophy (3,4). The SA model induces a robust increase in muscle size due to chronic MOV (5) and has revealed the importance, as described below, of protein synthesis, mTORC1 signaling, and ribosome biogenesis in muscle hypertrophy (6). Importantly, the SA model has provided the fundamental knowledge that mechanical loading is the primary factor through which resistance exercise training promotes muscle hypertrophy in humans.Figure 1.Different models of mechanical overload. Mouse hindlimb anatomy shown, highlighting gastrocnemius complex consisting of gastrocnemius (GAS), plantaris (PLA), and soleus (SOL) muscles.

Created with Biorender.com.Download figureDownload PowerPointDespite the undeniable success of the SA model in the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of hypertrophy, critics remain. The most common critique of the SA model is its failure to accurately mimic resistance exercise in humans (3,5). Indeed, the SA model places a chronic, “round-the-clock” MOV on the synergist muscles. This chronic MOV induces a “supraphysiological” muscle growth (3,5,7). Although the approximately twofold increase in muscle mass following 14 days of MO"

The roots of maca contain active ingredients (triterpenes) that have a preventive effect on sarcopenia. However, the effect of maca on muscle hypertrophy has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the effects and mechanism of maca on muscle hypertrophy by adding different concentrations of yellow maca (0.1 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL) to C2C12 skeletal muscle cell culture. Two days after differentiation, maca was added for two days of incubation. The muscle diameter, area, differentiation index, and multinucleation, were assessed by immunostaining, and the expression levels of the proteins related to muscle protein synthesis/degradation were examined by Western blotting. Compared with the control group, the muscle diameter and area of the myotubes in the maca groups were significantly increased, and the cell differentiation index and multinucleation were significantly higher in the maca groups. Phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was elevated in the maca groups. Maca also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK. These results suggest that maca may promote muscle hypertrophy, differentiation, and maturation, potentially via the muscle hypertrophic signaling pathways such as Akt and mTOR, while exploring other pathways are needed.Keywords:maca, sarcopenia, muscle hypertrophy, aging, protein1. IntroductionSarcopenia is a progressive and age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and is associated with falls, physical disability, and mortality [1]. Healthy adults lose approximately 8% of their muscle mass every 10 years after the age of 40, and this rate will accelerate to 15% every 10 years after the age of 70 [2]. From a historical point of view, the aging population is a new problem, but projections indicate that by 2050, there will be more people aged 60 or older than adolescents aged 10–24 [3]. The muscles of elderly people have major defects in their regulatory and maintenance abilities during feeding and exercise [4]. In particular, age-related anabolic resistance may show up after prandial in the elderly [5], suggesting the importance of effective nutritional strategies against muscle wasting. Therefor"

Our previous studies of 8 wk of resistance training found that many metabolic syndrome men and women paradoxically increased IIx fibers with a decrease in IIa fibers. To confirm the hypothesis that obese subjects might have muscle remodeling after resistance training very different from healthy lean subjects, we subjected a group of nine obese male volunteers to progressive resistance training for a total of 16 wk. In these studies, weight loss was discouraged so that muscle changes would be attributed to the training alone. Detailed assessments included comparisons of histological examinations of needle biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle pretraining and at 8 and 16 wk. Prolonging the training from 8 to 16 wk resulted in increased strength, improved body composition, and more muscle fiber hypertrophy, but euglycemic clamp-quantified insulin responsiveness did not improve. Similar to prior studies, muscle fiber composition shifted toward more fast-twitch type IIx fibers (23 to 42%). Eight weeks of resistance training increased the muscle expression of phosphorylated Akt2 and mTOR. Muscle GLUT4 expression increased, although insulin receptor and IRS-1 expression did not change. We conclude that resistance training of prediabetic obese subjects is effective at changing muscle, resulting in fiber hypertrophy and increased type IIx fiber content, and these changes continue up to 16 wk of training.NEW & NOTEWORTHYObese, insulin-resistant men responded to 16 wk of progressive resistance training with muscle hypertrophy and increased strength and a shift in muscle fiber composition toward fast-twitch, type IIx fibers. Activation of muscle mTOR was increased by 8 wk but did not increase further at 16 wk despite continued augmentation of peak power and rate of force generation.human skeletal muscle fiber type plasticityis a well-established phenomenon (22). Resistance exercise training of healthy young men and women has consistently resulted in a shift within fast-twitch fibers from type IIx to type IIa (17,24). Training and detraining reports show "

Given the critical role of skeletal muscle atrophy in chronic conditions such as neuromuscular, metabolic, and cardiopulmonary disorders, SA represents a promising preclinical tool to study muscle hypertrophy mechanisms in pathological states. However, although extensively characterized in healthy animals, the potential applications of SA in disease models remain largely overlooked. This Mini-Review summarizes existing studies employing SA in rodent disease models, highlighting the diverse hypertrophic responses observed across conditions, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, obesity, diabetes, cancer cachexia, and chronic kidney disease. Although hypertrophy gains are generally attenuated in diseased animals compared to healthy controls, SA-induced overload provides valuable insights into disease-specific regulatory mechanisms, including alterations in intracellular signaling, fiber type transitions, and disease phenotype. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of SA as a preclinical model for resistance training in disease contexts and propose its broader adoption for mechanistic investigations into skeletal muscle plasticity under pathological conditions.INTRODUCTIONRecently, a series of excellent reviews providing a comprehensive overview of the synergist ablation (SA) model were published in theAmerican Journal of Physiology–Cell Physiology(1–3). SA typically involves the total or partial removal of the gastrocnemius and/or soleus muscles, thereby placing a mechanical overload on the remaining synergist, the plantaris muscle. This approach serves as a well-characterized and highly reproducible model of hypertrophy in rodents, mimicking the effects of human resistance training (RT). The authors should be commended for extensively discussing this topic, highlighting discoveries from this model, their translation to humans, and key methodological aspects.With this Mini-Review article, summarized inFig. 1, we aim to explore the potential of SA in rodent disease models, a largely "

Here we aimed to determine whether the same was true in men with previous RT experience using a whole-body RT program and whether postexercise systemic hormone concentrations were related to changes in hypertrophy and strength. Forty-nine resistance-trained men (23 ± 1 yr, mean ± SE) performed 12 wk of whole-body RT. Subjects were randomly allocated into a higher-repetition (HR) group who lifted loads of ∼30-50% of their maximal strength (1RM) for 20–25 repetitions/set (n= 24) or a lower-repetition (LR) group (∼75–90% 1RM, 8–12 repetitions/set,n= 25), with all sets being performed to volitional failure. Skeletal muscle biopsies, strength testing, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and acute changes in systemic hormone concentrations were examined pretraining and posttraining. In response to RT, 1RM strength increased for all exercises in both groups (P< 0.01), with only the change in bench press being significantly different between groups (HR, 9 ± 1, vs. LR, 14 ± 1 kg,P= 0.012). Fat- and bone-free (lean) body mass and type I and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area increased following training (P< 0.01) with no significant differences between groups. No significant correlations between the acute postexercise rise in any purported anabolic hormone and the change in strength or hypertrophy were found. In congruence with our previous work, acute postexercise systemic hormonal rises are not related to or in any way indicative of RT-mediated gains in muscle mass or strength. Our data show that in resistance-trained individuals, load, when exercises are performed to volitional failure, does not dict"

Beginning with genomics and transcriptomics, there are now omics datasets from hypertrophying skeletal muscle spanning methylomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, with further integration of single cell/nucleus-specific omics, among others. The purpose of this review is to explore the history of leveraging omics to enable understanding and discovery with respect to loading-induced hypertrophy in adult skeletal muscle. We elaborate on key historical and contemporary studies and findings, highlight specific examples where omics discoveries led to a mechanistic understanding of skeletal muscle growth, and provide background on established and emerging omic technologies. We focus on findings from human skeletal muscle tissue but also provide context and support from the rodent literature, including insights from gain- and loss-of-function experiments. Moving forward, the computational integration of omics datasets will provide unprecedented information and exciting new directions for studying how resistance exercise mediates skeletal muscle health. This information will help inform how to target key factors influencing muscle mass with a deep, comprehensive, and integrated multilayered understanding of their molecular regulation.INTRODUCTIONIn 1962, Jonas Bergström revolutionized the study of human skeletal muscle by reintroducing a modified needle biopsy technique, first described by Duchenne in the mid-nineteenth century. This “Bergström” biopsy technique allowed for serial sampling of muscle tissue from humans (1,2). The reintroduction of this technique paved the way for biochemical analyses (e.g., histochemistry, enzyme activity, substrate utilization, etc.) of skeletal muscle from humans in response to acute and chronic exercise training (3–5). The expanded use of biochemical techniques in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the forerunner for more advanced methods and technologies capable of capturing the molecular underpinnings of exercise’s effect on skeletal muscle. Foundational findings from this era, along with advancements in both complexity and efficiency of molecular biology techniques, ushered in the modern era of omics-focused adult skeletal muscle loading-induced hypertrophy research.Major breakthroughs in molecular biology occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. These advancements include Paul Berg’s research on recombinant DNA technology (6), Gilbert and Sanger’s methods for sequencing DNA (7,8), and Kary Mullis developing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify single DNA fragments (9–11). All of these discoveries ultimately earned Nobel Prizes in chemistry or physiology and medicine. The early adopti"

As a result, there is extensive effort directed at developing drugs capable of targeting myostatin to treat patients with muscle loss. One potential concern with this therapeutic approach in patients with muscle degenerative diseases like muscular dystrophy is that inducing hypertrophy may increase stress on dystrophic fibers, thereby accelerating disease progression. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of blocking the myostatin pathway indysferlin-deficient (Dysf−/−) mice, in which membrane repair is compromised, either by transgenic expression of follistatin in skeletal muscle or by systemic administration of the soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B/Fc). Here, we show that myostatin inhibition by follistatin transgene expression inDysf−/−mice results in early improvement in histopathology but ultimately exacerbates muscle degeneration; this effect was not observed indystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice, suggesting that accelerated degeneration induced by follistatin transgene expression is specific to mice lackingdysferlin. Dysf−/−mice injected with ACVR2B/Fc showed significant increases in muscle mass and amelioration of fibrotic changes normally seen in 8-month-oldDysf−/−mice. Despite these potentially beneficial effects, ACVR2B/Fc treatment caused increases in serum CK levels in someDysf−/−mice, indicating possible muscle damage induced by hypertrophy. These findings suggest that depending on the disease context, inducing muscle hypertrophy by myostatin blockade may have detrimental effects, which need to be weighed against the potential gains in muscle growth and decreased fibrosis.IntroductionMyostatin is a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass (1). Genetic studies in numerous species have shown that loss of myostatin results in dramatic increases in muscle mass (2–7), and pharm"

Although the inverse correlation between glycative stress and muscle mass and strength has been demonstrated, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to elucidate how glycative stress affects the skeletal muscle, particularly the adaptive muscle response to hypertrophic stimuli and its molecular mechanism.MethodsMale C57BL/6NCr mice were randomly divided into the following two groups: the bovine serum albumin (BSA)‐treated and AGE‐treated groups. Mice in the AGE‐treated group were intraperitoneally administered AGEs (0.5 mg/g) once daily, whereas those in the BSA‐treated group received an equal amount of BSA (0.5 mg/g) as the vehicle control. After 7 days of continuous administration, the right leg plantaris muscle of mice in each group underwent functional overload treatment by synergist ablation for 7 days to induce muscle hypertrophy. In in vitro studies, cultured C2C12 myocytes were treated with AGEs (1 mg/mL) to examine cell adhesion and cell membrane permeability.ResultsContinuous AGE administration increased the levels of fluorescent AGEs, Nε‐(carboxymethyl) lysine, and methylglyoxal‐derived hydroimidazolone‐1 in both plasma and skeletal muscle. Plantaris muscle weight, muscle fibre cross‐sectional area, protein synthesis rate, and the number of myonuclei increased with functional overload in both groups; however, the increase was significantly reduced by AGE treatment.

Injection techniqueFifty units of onabotA were injected into the most prominent strip of the upper portion of the trapezius muscle following the model (Figure1).FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabTechnique for the delimitation of the trapezius muscle and treatment point strategy. Injection points were separated by a distance of 1.5–2.5 cm each. A 27‐gauge injection needle was used. For the treatment of the trapezius muscles, 10 U per selected point was administered [Color figure can be viewed atwileyonlinelibrary.com]1.2. MeasurementsWith the patient looking straight ahead, we measured the distance between the inferior tip of the mastoid process to the base of the neck (MPNB) and between the shoulder and the base of the neck (SNB) (Figure S1).1.3. Patient satisfactionWe used a 5‐point Likert scale (Strongly disagree; Disagree; Neither agree nor disagree; Agree; and Strongly agree) to evaluate the satisfaction of the patient. The scale consisted of two questions: Are you satisfied with the treatment results? Would you repeat the treatment?2. RESULTSEleven patients were included in the analysis. The median (range) age was 34.0 (23.0 to 46.0) years, and all the patients were women. Median (range) administered dose of onabotA was 50.0 (35.0–60.0) U in the right side and 50.0 (15.0–60) in the left one.There were no significant differences at baseline between the right and the left sides in either MPNB (p= 0.0859) or SNB (0.1929).Median (95%CI) reductions in MPNB were 1.5 (1.0–1.9) cm,p= 0.0033 (Figure2A), 1.5 (1.2–2.0) cm,p= 0.0033 (Figure2B), in the right and left sides, respectively. Median increases in SNB were 0.8 (0.5–1.1) cm,p= 0.0051 (Figure2C), and 1.0 (0.6–1.2) cm,p= 0.0051 (Figure2D), in the right and left sides, respectively.FIGURE 2.Open in a new tabOverview of the different study measurements. The vertical bars represent the 95% confidence interval. A, MPNB in the right trapezius muscle. B, MPNB in the left trapezius muscle. C, SNB in the right trapezius muscle. D, SNB in the left trapezius muscle. MPNB: Mean distance from mastoid process to the base of the neck; SNB: mean distance from shoulder to the base of the neck. Statistical significance, as compared to baseline, was determined using the Wilcoxon test with the Hodges‐Lehmann estimate of location shift. *p< 0.01Clinical results, assessed by means of photographs, have shown a significant aesthetic improvement (FiguresS2andS3).Patients showed high satisfaction levels, with 9 (81.8%) patients reporting to be “Strongly agree” and 2 (18.2%) ones “agree,” with the treatment results. Regarding the question: Would you repeat the treatment? 72.7% (8/11) patients report to be “Strongly agree” and 3 (27.3%) ones “agree,” with the question.Five (45.5%) patients reported pain at the time of injection, which was resolved spontaneously without treatment.

To address this limitation, we developed a novel progressive weighted-wheel-running (PoWeR) model of murine exercise training to test whether myonuclei gained during exercise persist after detraining. We hypothesized that myonuclei acquired during training-induced hypertrophy would remain following loss of muscle mass with detraining. Singly housed female C57BL/6J mice performed 8 wk of PoWeR, while another group performed 8 wk of PoWeR followed by 12 wk of detraining. Age-matched sedentary cage-dwelling mice served as untrained controls. Eight weeks of PoWeR yielded significant plantaris muscle fiber hypertrophy, a shift to a more oxidative phen"

However, the effect of BFR on muscle endurance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of BFR on muscle performance and adaptation, with special reference to local muscle endurance. In experiment 1, eight healthy men performed unilateral elbow flexion exercise to failure at 30% of one‐repetition maximum with BFR (at 40% of estimated arterial occlusion pressure) and free blood flow (FBF). During the exercise, muscle activity and tissue oxygenation were measured from the biceps brachii. In experiment 2, another eight healthy men completed 6 weeks of elbow flexion training with BFR and FBF. The number of repetitions to failure at submaximal load (Rmax), the estimated time for peak torque output to decay by 50% during repetitive maximum voluntary contractions (half‐time), one‐repetition maximum, isometric strength and muscle thickness of elbow flexors were measured pre‐ and post‐training. Blood flow restriction resulted in fewer repetitions and lower muscle tissue oxygenation at the end of exercise than FBF, while the muscle activity increased similarly to repetition failure. Blood flow restriction also resulted in a smaller post‐trainingRmax, which was strongly correlated with the total exercise volume over the 6 week period. Despite the smaller exercise volume, BFR resulted in similar improvements in half‐time, muscle strength and thickness compared with FBF. These results suggest that the application of BFR can attenuate muscle endurance adaptations to low‐load resistance training by decreasing the number of repetitions during exercise, both acutely and chronically.Keywords:chronic adaptations, electromyography, local muscle endurance, near‐infrared spectroscopy, strength trainingWhat is the central question of this study?How does blood flow restriction (BFR) affect adaptations of muscle endurance, strength and hypertrophy in response to low‐load resistance exercise to volitional failure?What is the main finding and its importance?Low‐load resistance training with and without BFR improved muscle strength and thickness to a similar extent. However, the number of repetitions achieved during submaximal exercise, which is an indicator of muscle endurance, showed a much smaller improvement when trained with BFR than without. The results suggest that BFR can attenuate the improvement in muscle endurance by decreasing the total exercise volume achieved for a certain period of training.1. INTRODUCTIONIt is widely known that resistance training improves muscle mass and function. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guideline recommends using a load of ≥60% of one‐repetition maximum (1RM) with ≤12 repetitions to improve muscle strength, and ≤50% of 1RM with 10–25 repetitions or more to improve local muscle endurance (ACSM,2009; Deschenes & Garber,2018). Severe metabolic stress and fatigue typically induced by low‐load, high‐repetition exercise are thought to be an important stimulus for muscle adaptations necessary to improve muscle endurance (ACSM,2009; Mang et al.,2022). Low‐load resistance exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR), in which an elastic band or a pneumatic cuff placed at the proximal end of the limb partly restricts arterial inflow "

In general, males in most animals are larger than females at the same age, however, in quail, females have a larger body size with greater muscle mass than males. To understand what characteristics in muscle growth play roles in reversed sexual dimorphism in quail, the weights and the characteristics of thepectoralis majorandgastrocnemiusmuscles (PMandGM, respectively) of male and female quail were compared in the current study. The data showed that 15-wk-old female quail have significantly heavier bodies, and PM and GM weights compared to male quail (1.27-folds, 1.29-folds, and 1.16-folds, respectively). To compare muscle characteristics such as hypertrophy (increased size) and hyperplasia (increased cell number), the PM and GM were stained using hematoxylin and eosin, and then histological characteristics such as total cross-sectional area (CSA), number and size of myofibers, and muscle bundle of the muscles were measured and analyzed. In both PM and GM, there were no differences in total numbers of myofibers and muscle bundles as well as the average numbers of myofibers per bundle between sexes. However, the sizes of myofiber and the bundle were significantly increased in female compared to male (1.33-folds and 1.28-folds in PM, and both 1.23-folds in GM, respectively). The findings of the current study suggest that muscle hypertrophy in female quail, not hyperplasia, can be attributed to the sexual dimorphism in quail size.Key words:sexual dimorphism, hypertrophy, myofiber, muscle bundle, quailINTRODUCTIONSexual dimorphism in animals is related to body compositions such as skeletal structure, body weights and shape, and metabolism pathways. In humans, males have a similar fat mass to females, but have greater lean mass at birth (Wells, 2007). Male mice have heavier body compositions than female mice including body and muscle weights at similar ages (Clemens et al., 2021).In most avian species, males are generally larger and heavier than females (Remeš and Székely, 2010). For example, body weights of male chickens are 1.22-folds heavier compared to those of female chickens, and male pheasants exhibit 1.38-folds heavier than female pheasants (Remeš and Székely, 2010). Males in Muscovy duck show a much faster growing performance than female ducks (Baéza et al., 2001). Moreover, male broiler chickens are significantly heavier, as well as increased myofibers in sizes and numbers, compared to the female at embryonic age (Henry and Burke, 1998). In addition, because breast and leg muscles have a high proportion of meat production in poultry species, we reported comparisons of muscle characteristics inpectoralis majorandgastrocnemiusmuscles (PMandGM, respectively) in chickens; fast-growing chickens exhibited greater numbers and sizes of myofiber and muscle bundles in PM and GM, compared to slow-growing chickens (Lee et al., 2023). Although, in the birds of prey and quail, the female is larger than the male (Pitzer et al., 2008;Lee et al., 2020). there has been no evidence of muscle characteristics that can explain reversed sexual dimorphism.Sexually dimorphic differences may be driven by differences in the growth rate of whole-body as well as growing patterns of skeletal muscles correlated to the whole muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and myofiber and bundle size. Although growing performance is definitively different between male and female quail, there is a lack of further investigation focusing on the muscle characteristics that are responsible for reversed sexual dimorphism.

Therapies to restore dystrophin deficiency have been approved in some jurisdictions but long-term effectiveness is yet to be established. There is a need to develop alternative strategies to treat DMD. Resveratrol is a nutraceutical with anti-inflammatory properties. Previous studies have shown high doses (100–400 mg/kg bodyweight/day) benefitmdxmice. We treated 4-week-oldmdxand wildtype mice with a lower dose of resveratrol (5 mg/kg bodyweight/day) for 15 weeks. Voluntary exercise was used to test if a lower dosage than previously tested could reduce exercise-induced damage where a greater inflammatory infiltrate is present. We found resveratrol promoted skeletal muscle hypertrophy in wildtype mice. In dystrophic muscle, resveratrol reduced exercise-induced muscle necrosis. Gene expression of immune cell markers, CD86 and CD163 were reduced; however, signalling targets associated with resveratrol’s mechanism of action including Sirt1 and NF-κB were unchanged. In conclusion, a lower dose of resveratrol compared to the dosage used by other studies reduced necrosis and gene expression of inflammatory cell markers in dystrophic muscle suggesting it as a therapeutic candidate for treating DMD.Keywords:muscle, muscular dystrophy, mdx, resveratrol, nutraceuticals, duchenne, inflammation1. IntroductionDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder, that arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene [1] and leads to the absence or severe deficiency of the dystrophin protein [2]. Corticosteroids are used in DMD patients to prolong ambulation and maintain respiratory health; however, they have adverse side effects [3], [4]. Many types of therapeutics are in development for DMD and include gene correction strategies, exon skipping and utrophin upregulation; some of these therapies are in the initial stages of clinical use [5]. Despite these advances, there is still a need to develop alternative strategies to treat DMD which could be implemented in the short term, especially for patients with mutations not amenable to current trials; or in the longer term as an adjunct to corticosteroids and gene correction strategies.Nutraceutical use is increasingly popular and this trend has not escaped the DMD community [6]. Whilst nutraceuticals are not able to correct the genetic defect in DMD, many have anti-inflammat"

Since the first microscopic identification by Mauro in 19612muscle biologists have been fascinated with the role(s), regulation, and therapeutic potential of this muscle stem/progenitor cell population.Early studies implicated satellite cells as critical contributors to muscle growth, repair, maintenance, and hypertrophy; with many comprehensive reviews highlighting these original works.3,4More recent research efforts have focused on the molecular mechanisms regulating satellite cell function in health and during a number of extreme experimental conditions (chemically-induced injury, crush, synergist ablation, genetic disease models).4,5While there is no disputing the importance and relevance of these studies to understanding satellite cell biology, the translatability of these findings to more moderate activities/stressors which may be encountered more routinely in everyday life remain less clear.Within this investigative framework entered a new mouse model, the Pax7CreER; R26DTA/+ (Pax7-DTA) mouse. This mouse model allows for the specific and inducible depletion of satellite cells upon tamoxifen treatment. Using this approach, Peterson and colleagues have revisited a number of the earlier studies investigating the importance of satellite cells to many facets of skeletal muscle health. Collectively their studies have demonstrated that satellite cells are not requisite for hypertrophy in the short term, but they are essential for sustained muscle growth in the long term.6–8While these more recent investigations have greatly increased our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms underlying the complexity of satellite cell behavior, and the particular stressors where satellite cells are essential for muscle health, an understanding of the relationship between the satellite cell and the myonuclei remained a fundamental gap in our current understanding. It is within this context where the present study from Englund et al. provides insight.1By using their satellite cell-depleted mouse model and the physiological stress of progressive weighted running (which they termed PoWeR) they were able to investigate the contributions of satellite cells to an exercise-induced, hypertrophic stimulus. What the authors found was, that while satellite cell depleted soleus and plantaris muscles can adapt to a considerable degree in response to exercise, ultimately, muscle growth, strength, capillarization, and collagen remodeling were blunted when compared to satellite cell replete muscle. Transcriptional profiling of the skeletal muscles at multiple time points over the course of adaptation revealed several exercise-induced pathways were dysregulated in the absence of satellite cells, potentially contributing to the attenuated adaptation. This is the first study to examine how satellite cell content influences the myonuclear transcriptome in response to exercise, enabling the identification of pathways transcriptionally regulated by myonuclei (eg, ribosome biogenesis and metabolic adaptation) vs processes regulated by other cell types in the muscle compartment that promote adaptation to exercise. This integrative approach not only allowed for a more complete understanding of how muscles respond to exercise in the presence or absence of satellite cells, but also how the transcriptome of the muscle can be impacted by the presence or absence of satellite cells.In many ways, this work is an elegant follow-up to the work of Murach et al.9who demonstrated that satellite cells can communic"

To unravel the respective role of chronic hypoxia and pulmonary inflammation on soleus muscle hypertrophic capacities, we challenged male Wistar rats to repeated lipopolysaccharide instillations, associated or not with a chronic hypoxia exposure. Muscle hypertrophy was initiated by bilateral ablation of soleus agonists 1 week before sacrifice. To understand the role played by the histone acetylation, we also treated our animals with an inhibitor of bromodomains and extra terminal proteins (I-BET) during the week after surgery. Pulmonary inflammation totally inhibited this hypertrophy response under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (26% lower than control surgery, p < 0.05), consistent with the S6K1 and myogenin measurements. Changes in histone acetylation and class IIa histone deacetylases expression, following pulmonary inflammation, suggested a putative role for histone acetylation signaling in the altered hypertrophy response. The I-BET drug restored the hypertrophy response suggesting that the non-response of muscle to a hypertrophic stimulus could be modulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone-acetylation dependant pathways. Drugs targeting such epigenetic mechanisms may open therapeutic perspectives for COPD patients with systemic inflammation who are unresponsive to rehabilitation.IntroductionChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) "

Transient reductions in whole muscle force production have been reported during the onset of hypertrophy, but contractile changes in individual muscle fibers have not been previously studied. Additionally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) stores and transmits forces from muscle fibers to tendons and bones, and determining how the ECM changes during hypertrophy is important in understanding the adaptation of muscle tissue to mechanical loading. Using the synergist ablation model, we sought to measure changes in muscle fiber contractility, collagen content, and cross-linking, and in the expression of several genes and activation of signaling proteins that regulate critical components of myogenesis and ECM synthesis and remodeling during muscle hypertrophy. Tissues were harvested 3, 7, and 28 days after induction of hypertrophy, and nonoverloaded rats served as controls. Muscle fiber specific force (sFo), which is the maximum isometric force normalized to cross-sectional area, was reduced 3 and 7 days after the onset of mechanical overload, but returned to control levels by 28 days. Collagen abundance displayed a similar pattern of change. Nearly a quarter of the transcriptome changed over the course of overload, as well as the activation of signaling pathways related to hypertrophy and atrophy. Overall, this study provides insight into fundamental mechanisms of muscle and ECM growth, and indicates that although muscle fibers appear to have completed remodeling and regeneration 1 mo after synergist ablation, the ECM continues to be actively remodeling at this time point.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis study utilized a rat synergist ablation model to integrate changes in single muscle fiber contractility, extracellular matrix composition, activation of important signaling"

Recently, studies in mouse models of muscle wasting or acutely exercised human muscle have suggested a potential role for the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), in adaptive growth. Hence, in the present study we sought to define the contribution of STAT3 to skeletal muscle adaptive growth. In contrast to previous work, two different resistance exercise protocols did not change STAT3 phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle. To directly address the role of STAT3 in load-induced (i.e., adaptive) growth, we studied the anabolic effects of 14 days of synergist ablation (SA) in skeletal muscle-specific STAT3 knockout (mKO) mice and their floxed, wild-type (WT) littermates. Plantaris muscle weight and fiber area in the nonoperated leg (control; CON) was comparable between genotypes. As expected, SA significantly increased plantaris weight, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and anabolic signaling in WT mice, although interestingly, this induction was not impaired in STAT3 mKO mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that STAT3 is not required for overload-mediated hypertrophy in mouse skeletal muscle.skeletal muscle wastingis a hallmark of several diseases, including cancer cachexia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, and diabetes (4,14). These diseases are characterized by elevated levels of circulatory proinflammatory cytokines, which subsequently promote skeletal muscle atrophy (4,14). Resistance exercise and dietary proteins are key stimuli to offset skeletal muscle wasting, mainly by increasing the rate of protein synthesis via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways (7,10). Although the transcriptional mechanisms regulating resistance exercise-mediated skeletal mus"

In this invited perspective, we aim to complement their original perspective by discussing limitations to the model along with alternative mechanical overload models that have strengths and limitations.INTRODUCTIONIn their Review, Burke et al. (1) provide an excellent historical account of the origins of the synergist ablation (SA) model along with hypertrophy-associated mechanisms discovered by various laboratories using the model. The authors also outline model discoveries that have predated human resistance training discoveries (their Figure 2) and posit new frontiers that can be pursued using SA. We commend Burke et al. for this excellent contribution. However, although the McCarthy laboratory has co-authored papers discussing limitations to the SA procedure [for example (2)], these and other critical limitations were either diminished or not detailed by Burke et al., leaving the readership to only consider the model’s upside. Accordingly, the aim of thisinvitedReview is to detail what we deem are limitations with SA. We also provide commentary meant to stimulate thought for unfamiliar readers.Before delving into these topics, it is worth mentioning that the current authors as well as Dr. McCarthy coauthored a 2023 review outlining the history of skeletal muscle hypertrophy research (3), and all authors of that review amicably agreed on the profound impact that the SA model has had on the field. The current authors have also either used the SA model (examples include Refs.4–7) or have leveraged muscle collected from SA experiments to provide alongside human datasets (8,9). Hence, we have a mutual appreciation for the SA model as being means to study the hypertrophic response to mechanical overload.HUMAN VERSUS RODENT CONSIDERATIONSBefore providing various critiques to the SA model, we would like to describe some of the basic human-rodent species differences for the unfamiliar reader. For instance, there are clear discrepancies between humans and mice when it comes to body size, metabolic rate, myofiber size, and myofiber oxidative phenotype (2). Rangarajan et al. (10) provide more granular details when comparing mice and humans whereby the authors note:1) humans are ∼3000× larger than mice,2) mice are nocturnal,3) humans live 30–50× longer than mice,4) an estimated 100,000× more cellular division occurs in mitotically active cells in humans versus mice (note by the current authors, this may affect satellite cell interpretations between species). Furthermore, protein synthesis rates are 1.3- to 2-fold higher in type I versus type II fibers of mice (11), whereas fiber type differences in protein synthesis rates are less dramatic in the resting and post-exercise "

We investigated the effects of microvascular hypoxia [i.e., low microvascular O2partial pressures (PmvO2)] during contractions on muscle hypertrophic signaling, growth response, and key muscle adaptations for increasing exercise capacity. Wistar rats were fitted with a cuff placed around the upper thigh and inflated to restrict limb blood flow. Low-force isometric contractions (30 Hz) were evoked via electrical stimulation of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. The PmvO2was determined by phosphorescence quenching. Rats underwent acute and chronic stimulation protocols. Whereas PmvO2decreased transiently with 30 Hz contractions, simultaneous BFR induced severe hypoxia, reducing PmvO2lower than present for maximal (100 Hz) contractions. Low-force electrical stimulation (EXER) induced muscle hypertrophy (6.2%,P< 0.01), whereas control group conditions or BFR alone did not.

To directly test this hypothesis, we utilized the Pax7-DTA mouse model to deplete satellite cells in skeletal muscle followed by testosterone administration. Pax7-DTA mice (6 mo of age) were treated for 5 days with either vehicle [satellite cell replete (SC+)] or tamoxifen [satellite cell depleted (SC-)]. Following a washout period, a testosterone propionate or sham pellet was implanted for 21 days. Testosterone administration caused a significant increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area in SC+ and SC- mice in both oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic (plantaris and extensor digitorum longus) muscles. In SC+ mice treated with testosterone, there was a significant increase in both satellite cell abundance and myonuclei that was completely absent in testosterone-treated SC- mice. These findings provide direct evidence that testosterone-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy does not require an increase in satellite cell abundance or myonuclear accretion.Listen to a podcast about this Rapid Report with senior author E.

However, this process has not yet been confirmed on a histologic level.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to evaluate in-vivo structural changes in striated porcine muscle tissue following HIFEM treatment.MethodsThree Yorkshire pigs received four 30-minute HIFEM treatments applied to the biceps femoris muscle on 1 side only. The fourth pig served as a control subject. At baseline and 2 weeks after the last treatment, biopsy specimens of the muscle tissue were collected from the treatment site. The control pig underwent muscle biopsy from a similar but untreated site. Twenty-five histology slides were evaluated from each pig. A certified histopathologist analyzed sliced biopsy samples for structural changes in the tissue.ResultsHistologic analysis showed hypertrophic changes 2 weeks posttreatment. The muscle mass density increased by 20.56% (to a mean of 17,053.4 [5617.9] µm2) compared with baseline. Similarly, muscle fiber density (hyperplasia) increased: the average change in the number of fibers in a slice area of 136,533.3 µm2was +8.0%. The mean size of an individual muscle fiber increased by 12.15% (to 332.23 [280.2] µm2) 2 weeks posttreatment. Control samples did not show any significant change in fiber density or hyperplasia.ConclusionsHistopathologic quantification showed significant structural muscle changes through a combination of fiber hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Control biopsies showed a lack of similar changes. The data correlate with findings of other HIFEM research and suggest that HIFEM could be used for noninvasive induction of muscle growth.Muscles have long been neglected in the body-shaping industry, which predominantly deals with subcutaneous fat deposits. However, strong and firm muscles significantly contribute to the overall aesthetic appearance. High-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) field technology has recently been introduced in the field of aesthetic medicine to provide physicians with a tool for muscle toning and strengthening beyond the capability of normal exercise.Current noninvasive body-shaping devices are based on heating or cooling of subcutaneous fat tissue to levels that fat cells can no longer tolerate, consequently triggering programmed cell death—apoptosis.1The heating modalities of these radiofrequency devices are based on emitting electromagnetic waves of high frequencies (0.5-50 MHz)2which are predominantly absorbed in the subcutaneous fat tissue, where the energy of the waves is transformed into heat. HIFEM technology, on the other hand, does not deliver any heating through electromagnetic radiation, as it utilizes magnetic waves of very low frequencies (3-5 kHz) which propagate through the tissue without being absorbed. In this case, an interaction between the wave and human tissue occurs according to the principles of electromagnetic induction, first described by Michael Faraday in 1831. The law of electromagnetic induction says that any change in a magnetic field induces an electric current and vice versa. The HIFEM device comprises a circular coil located in the applicator, which is placed over the treatment area. During the treatment, an alternating electric current is sent into the circular coil. The alternations in the electric current induce rapidly changing magnetic waves which propagate into the underlying tissue, where they induce a secondary electric current. These electric currents within the tissu"

Using a blinded, randomized, controlled design, 36 resistance-untrained individuals were assigned to one of the three groups: control (CON), Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), or stiff-leg deadlift (SDL). Strength gain was measured as changes in one-repetition maximum (1RM). Changes in semimembranosus (SM), semitendinosus (ST), and biceps femoris (BF) muscle volume were measured using three-dimensional (3-D) freehand ultrasound. Activation of each hamstring muscle head was assessed using surface electromyography during the trained exercise (or both for CON) performed at 80% of 1RM. We found a significant increase in 1RM after 9 wk for the NHE (37.4 ± 13.8%) and SDL (34.0 ± 21.2%) groups compared with CON. This strength gain was accompanied by selective hypertrophy of ST (24.3 ± 10.8%) and SM (11.2 ± 12.7%), for the NHE and SDL groups, respectively. However, statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that muscle activation was not altered over time, between the groups, or by their interactions (allP≥ 0.05). Our findings demonstrate the robustness of muscle activation strategies over time despite training-induced selective hypertrophy. These results provide a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between neural drive and muscle mechanical characteristics. This provides additional impetus to study long-term effects of activation strategies (e.g., on the development of musculoskeletal disorders), as they seem to represent a trait-like characteristic rather than a transient state.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe demonstrate that stiff-leg deadlift and Nordic hamstring exercises are effective in inducing selective hypertrophy of the semimembranosus (11.2%) and semitendinosus (24.4%), respectively. Hamstring muscle activation did not adapt to the change in the distribution of muscle volume. These resistance training exercises, commonly used in hamstring prevention and rehabilitation strategies, appear effective at increasing the force-generating potential of the targeted muscles in noninjured individuals, as their muscle volume increases without altering their activation strategies.INTRODUCTIONIt is widely accepted that the nervous system adapts muscle activation to minimize movement costs, aligning with the principles of optimal control theory (1). In this framework, the selection and weighting of muscle recruitment are sha"

In this study, we investigated whether lactate administration enhanced muscle hypertrophy and protein synthesis responses during resistance exercise in animal models. We used male ICR mice (7–8 weeks old) were used for chronic (mechanical overload induced by synergist ablation: [OL]) and acute (high‐intensity muscle contraction by electrical stimulation: [ES]) resistance exercise models. The animals were intraperitoneally administrated a single dose of sodium lactate (1 g/kg of body weight) in the ES study, and once a day for 14 consecutive days in the OL study. Two weeks of mechanical overload increased plantaris muscle wet weight (main effect of OL:p< 0.05) and fiber cross‐sectional area (main effect of OL:p< 0.05), but those were not affected by lactate administration. Following the acute resistance exercise by ES, protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6, which are downstream molecules in the anabolic signaling cascade, were increased (main effect of ES:p< 0.05), but lactate administration had no effect. This study demonstrated that exogenous lactate administration has little effect on the muscle hypertrophic response during resistance exercise using acute ES and chronic OL models. Our results do not support the hypothesis that elevated blood lactate concentration induces protein synthesis responses in skeletal muscle.Keywords:hypertrophy; lactate; mTOR signaling, protein synthesis; skeletal muscleIn this study, we examined the effects of lactate administration on the activation of exercise‐induced protein synthesis signals and muscle hypertrophy using acute and chronic resistance exercise models.

The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether exogenously administered testosterone alters muscle fiber morphology in skeletal muscle of young healthy, physically active women. Thirty-five young (20–35 yr), recreationally trained women were randomly assigned to either 10-wk testosterone administration (10 mg daily) or placebo. Before and after the intervention, hormone concentrations and body composition were assessed, and muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis. Fiber type composition, fiber size, satellite cell and myonuclei content, as well as muscle capillarization were assessed in a fiber type-specific manner by immunohistochemistry. After the intervention, testosterone administration elevated serum testosterone concentration (5.1-fold increase,P= 0.001) and induced significant accretion of total lean mass (+1.9%,P= 0.002) and leg lean mass (+2.4%,P= 0.001). On the muscle fiber level, testosterone increased mixed-fiber cross-sectional area (+8.2%,P= 0.001), an effect primarily driven by increases in type II fiber size (9.2%,P= 0.006). Whereas myonuclei content remained unchanged, a numerical increase (+30.8%) was found for satellite cells associated with type II fibers in the Testosterone group. In parallel with fiber hypertrophy, testosterone significantly increased capillary contacts (+7.5%,P= 0.015) and capillary-to-fiber ratio (+9.2%,P= 0.001) in type II muscle fibers. The present study provides novel insight into fiber type-specific adaptations present already after 10 wk of only moderately elevated testosterone levels in women.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe have recently demonstrated performance-enhancing effects of moderately elevated testosterone concentrations in young women"

With aging and/or diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, muscle atrophy is commonly associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality (2). Muscle mass is maintained by the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes, with decreased rates of muscle protein synthesis and higher rates of protein degradation present in these disease states (2). Although there are well-established methods for inducing muscular hypertrophy like resistance training, the specific molecular mechanisms dictating muscle growth are not entirely understood.In this issue ofAmerican Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology, an elegant study performed by Pérez-Schindler et al. (3) examines the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in load-induced muscle hypertrophy in humans and mouse models. The investigators collected skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy male subjects who had performed a single bout of resistance exercise. STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) was then examined in the muscle samples, with no differences detected across groups. Concurrently, the authors utilized a synergist ablation (SA) surgery on skeletal muscle-specific STAT3 knockout (KO) mice to induce mechanical overload and hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle. Despite lacking STAT3 in the skeletal muscle of the KO mice, no differences in plantaris mass or fiber cross-sectional area were observed when compared with the wild-type (WT) mice. They observed similar decreases in myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass, and similar increases in activation of canonical muscle growth pathways (mTORC1) in KO mice compared with WT mice (3). Together, these findings suggest that STAT3 localized to the mature skeletal muscle cell is not playing a necessary role in load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.Current evidence would suggest that STAT3 is involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy through a pathway dependent on the interleukin-6 family of cytokines [IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), etc.]. Both acute resistance exercise and resistance training were shown to upregulate IL-6 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle of Wistar rats, accompanied with increased STAT3 phosphorylation and upregulation of STAT3-dependent genes (1). Genetic deletion of LIF blunted the hypertrophic response of the plantaris and soleus muscles with SA; however, pSTAT3 levels similarly increased when compared"

These include pain on the injection site being the most common, followed by localized swelling, bruising, headache, chewing weakness and aching, and the development of an asymmetric smile, among others.3Indeed, such concerns had already been alluded to in a Cochrane review in 2013, which concluded that there was a lack of high-level evidence for the efficacy and safety of intra-masseteric injections of Botulinum toxin for patients with bilateral benign masseteric hypertrophy.4More recently, investigators have even looked into ultrasound-guided injections of Botulinum toxin for the masseters and claimed superiority of such over the “conventional” blind technique.5Curiously, this so-called conventional blind technique was not included in the recent review of techniques2above.Herein, we would like to share a simple injection technique for masseter reduction with Botulinum toxin that has been in use by the senior author (T.Y.) since 2010 and utilized successfully by a less experienced practitioner (Z.Y.N.) during the period October 2019 to July 2020 in 55 patients with only 1 case of inadequate treatment response.Prior to entering the treatment room, Eutectic Mixture Local Anesthetics cream (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) is applied for approximately 30 minutes bilaterally at the lower masseter area, near the angle of the mandible. Patients are then asked to clench and hold their teeth to enable the anterior border (Line A) and most prominent bulge (X) of the masseter to be marked (Figure 1); they are allowed to relax after. Depending on individual anatomy, a second line is then drawn from either the tragus (Line B) or the inferior border of the ear lobe (Line B’) to the corner of the mouth, with the aim of capturing the majority of the masseter bulk within these 2 lines (Figure 1) to minimize the risk of diffusion into the zygomaticus complex.Figure 1.Open in a new tabMarkings for a single Botulinum toxin injection point for masseter reduction in this 28-year-old female representative patient. Line A is drawn along the anterior border of the masseter with teeth clenched and the most prominent bulge of the muscle marked (X). Line B or B’, depending on individual anatomy, is then drawn towards the oral commissure to capture most of the masseter bulk.Skin cooling with a cold pack is then applied over the most prominent point followed by injection perpendicularly with a 30G needle in a 1-cc syringe until the mandible is felt. At this point, the needle is withdrawn slightly, and one-third of the Botulinum toxin is deposited. The needle is then re-oriented without withdrawal from the skin and advanced slightly for the next 2 deposits, usually anteriorly and superiorly; this is then repeated for the other side. The total time taken for the actual injections (×2 total) is usually less than 1 minute. Post procedure, there may be some punctate bleeding, but this resolves almost immediately with slight pressure. Pain and bruising are rare, and occasionally some patients report mild discomfort, but this is otherwise self-limiting and resolves within a few days.In our experience, patients with bilateral benign masseteric hypertrophy can be treated safely with this simple technique (Figure 2). Our preference is to use Dysport (Ipsen, Wrexham, UK), but Botox (Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) can be similarly administered, depending on patient preference and budget. Repeat procedures are performed, usually at"

During sports, skeletal muscle hypertrophy is induced by training to improve performance. Spermidine is a type of polyamine and oral intake of spermidine exerts many beneficial effects on health through various mechanisms, such as promoting autophagy and improving mitochondrial function. In a recent study, we showed that spermidine intake activates mTOR signaling and significantly increases the mean fiber cross‐sectional area (CSA) 14 days after injury. This suggests that spermidine promotes the anabolic growth of differentiated muscle (i.e., muscle hypertrophy); however, calorie restriction, which has been reported to have effects on the same molecular mechanisms as spermidine (promoting autophagy and improving mitochondrial function), promotes skeletal muscle regeneration, while inhibiting skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of spermidine intake on skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice using a synergistic ablation‐induced muscle hypertrophy model. Our results showed that spermidine intake significantly decreased mean myofiber of CSA, but this was not consistent with the change in skeletal muscle wet weight. We also analyzed autophagy, mTOR signaling, inflammation, and mitochondria, but no significant effects of spermidine intake were observed at most protein expression levels. Therefore, spermidine intake does not affect overload‐induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and even if it does, the effect is suppressive.Keywords:autophagy, mitochondria, mTOR signaling, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, spermidine1. INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscles are attached to bones via tendons and move joints by contracting, which enables physical movement. Skeletal muscle mass and cross‐sectional area (CSA) are determinants of the skeletal muscle contraction force and are important for athletic performance. Athletes constantly control their skeletal muscle mass by training and dietary management. Nutritional intake and mechanical stimulation by resistance training phosphorylate mTORC1 and its downstream target S6 (activating mTOR signaling). This increases protein synthesis in ribosomes and increases skeletal muscle mass. mTOR activates synthetic pathways while negatively regulating degradative pathways, such as autophagy (Atherton & Smith,2012). Autophagy is an intracellular degradation mechanism that improves the intracellular environment and supplies energy by breaking down intracellular components and unneeded molecules (Galluzzi & Green,2019). Under starvation conditions, such as calorie restriction, mTOR signaling is inactivated and autophagy is promoted, resulting in decreased skeletal m"

To address this issue, a novel mouse strain (Pax7-DTA) was created which enabled the conditional ablation of >90% of satellite cells in mature skeletal muscle following tamoxifen administration. To test the hypothesis that satellite cells are necessary for skeletal muscle hypertrophy, the plantaris muscle of adult Pax7-DTA mice was subjected to mechanical overload by surgical removal of the synergist muscle. Following two weeks of overload, satellite cell-depleted muscle showed the same increases in muscle mass (approximately twofold) and fiber cross-sectional area with hypertrophy as observed in the vehicle-treated group. The typical increase in myonuclei with hypertrophy was absent in satellite cell-depleted fibers, resulting in expansion of the myonuclear domain. Consistent with lack of nuclear addition to enlarged fibers, long-term BrdU labeling showed a significant reduction in the number of BrdU-positive myonuclei in satellite cell-depleted muscle compared with vehicle-treated muscle. Single fiber functional analyses showed no difference in specific force, Ca2+sensitivity, rate of cross-bridge cycling and cooperativity between hypertrophied fibers from vehicle and tamoxifen-treated groups. Although a small component of the hypertrophic response, both fiber hyperplasia and regeneration were significantly blunted following satellite cell depletion, indicating a distinct requirement for satellite cells during these processes. These results provide convincing evidence that skeletal muscle fibers are capable of mounting a rob"

In response to muscle overload after synergist ablation in mice, we show that myomaker, a muscle specific membrane protein essential for myoblast fusion, is activated mainly in muscle progenitors and not myofibers. We rendered muscle progenitors fusion-incompetent through genetic deletion of myomaker in muscle stem cells and observed a complete reduction of overload-induced hypertrophy. This blunted hypertrophic response was associated with a reduction in Akt and p70s6k signaling and protein synthesis, suggesting a link between myonuclear accretion and activation of pro-hypertrophic pathways. Furthermore, fusion-incompetent muscle exhibited increased fibrosis after muscle overload, indicating a protective role for normal stem cell activity in reducing myofiber strain associated with hypertrophy. These findings reveal an essential contribution of myomaker-mediated stem cell fusion during physiological adult muscle hypertrophy.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20007.001Research Organism:MouseeLife digestSkeletal muscle has a remarkable capacity to adapt to a variety of stimuli, including an ability to become larger and stronger through exercise. In embryos, new muscles develop from muscle stem cells, which either replicate themselves or “differentiate” into mature muscle cells. Adult muscles also contain stem cells, which are normally dormant, but activate when the muscle is damaged. The stem cells subsequently differentiate and fuse with one another or to existing muscle fibers to restore the muscle. What is not fully understood is whether this fusion process also helps undamaged adult muscles to increase in size (for example, in response to exercise).Fusion proteins such as myomaker – which specifically acts in muscles – help the stem cells to fuse. To investigate myomaker’s role in adult muscle growth, Goh and Millay deleted the gene that produces it from the muscle stem cells of mice. The mice then experienced two weeks of increased muscle activity, after which their muscle growth was compared with that of normal mice that had been subjected to the same activity routine.Goh and Millay discovered that myomaker is important in muscle stem cells, and not in muscle fibers, for adult muscle growth. After two weeks of increased muscle activity, substantial levels of muscle stem cell fusion had occurred in normal mice, and their muscles had grown significantly. However, the muscles of mice that lacked myomaker in their muscle stem cells did not increase in size.Additional experiments showed that normal muscle stem cell fusion activates signaling pathways that create new proteins and drive muscle growth. Furthermore, scarring occurred in muscles that lacked myomaker, suggesting that stem cell fusion also protects muscle fibers from damage during increased activity.Overall, the findings presented by Goh and Millay reveal that the fusion of muscle stem cells is an important event for adult muscle growth. Further studies are now needed to determine the relevance of muscle stem cell fusion during the normal aging process, and to uncover the relationship between fusion and the activation of pro-growth signaling pathways.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20007.002IntroductionAdult skeletal muscle exhibits a dramatic capacity to regenerate after injury owing to the presence of satellite cells (SCs), the resident muscle stem cells.

Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass in adults. TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key protein, which coordinates the activation of multiple signaling pathways. Recently, it was discovered that TAK1 is essential for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and myofiber hypertrophy following mechanical overload. Forced activation of TAK1 in skeletal muscle causes hypertrophy and attenuates denervation-induced muscle atrophy. TAK1-mediated signaling in skeletal muscle promotes protein synthesis, redox homeostasis, mitochondrial health, and integrity of neuromuscular junctions. In this article, we have reviewed the role and potential mechanisms through which TAK1 regulates skeletal muscle mass and growth. We have also proposed future areas of research that could be instrumental in exploring TAK1 as therapeutic target for improving muscle mass in various catabolic conditions and diseases.Keywords:Skeletal muscle atrophy, Hypertrophy, TAK1, protein synthesis, neuromuscular junctions, signalingGraphical Abstract:TAK1 is a central kinase that lies at the intersection of multiple signaling pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that TAK1 is essential for the growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. Here we have reviewed the current understanding about the role and mechanisms of action of TAK1 in skeletal muscle homeostasis.IntroductionSkeletal muscle, a strong predictor of longevity and health in humans, is a highly plastic multicellular tissue composed of individual multinucleated myofibers, neuronal supply, and vasculature. While the number of myofibers remain constant after attaining adulthood, several intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulate the area of individual myofibers in skeletal muscle tissue (1–3). Loss of muscle mass is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and in various conditions, including nerve injury, limb immobilization, prolonged bed rest, and in chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and heart failure (1,4,5).Skeletal muscle mass is governed by a delicate balance between the rate of protein synthesis and degradation that is regulated through coordinated activation of many intracellular pathways. Anabolic stimuli induce translational machinery to trigger protein synthesis. By contrast, catabolic stimuli augment the rate of myofibril protein degradation leading to skeletal muscle atrophy (6,7). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the most important mechanism that causes degradation of many short- and long-lived proteins in atrophying skeletal muscle (1,8). The major component of the UPS are the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze the transfer of the ubiquitin chains to the target protein (1,2,9,10). Levels of several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MAFbx, MuRF1, MUSA1, TRAF6, and UBR2 are dramatically increased in skeletal muscle in diverse catabolic states (1,2,9–12). Autophagy is another proteolytic system through which protein aggregates and defunct organelles are eliminated in mammalian cells. While basal level of autophagy is essential for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and health, excessive activation of autophagy that occurs in many catabolic conditions, such as cancer, sepsis, and func"

She had no past history of facial trauma, trismus, constitutional symptoms or periodontal disease. Upon examination (Figure 1), she presented facial asymmetry, swelling on the right mandibular angle, more evident with mandibular occlusion, and a mass was palpable, measuring 4cm in the longest axis, painless, with elastic consistency. There was an overlapping mass, with more consistent texture, 2cm diameter and attached to the bone. Laboratory tests showed no alterations, with negative inflammatory parameters and viral serology. Salivary glands ultrasound showed no detectable abnormalities. Face magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 2) demonstrated facial asymmetry involving the right masseter muscle and parotid gland, with no intrinsic pathology, and consistent with masseter muscle hypertrophy. The patient was referred to appointment at pediatric surgery, for aesthetic procedure, if necessary.Figure 1. Adolescent with asymmetry due to right mandibular swelling.Open in a new tabFigure 2. Coronal magnetic resonance imaging showing asymmetry of the right masseter muscle.Open in a new tabThis condition has a benign behavior, with essentially aesthetic implications, because of asymmetric lower third of the face. The treatment is conservative, using some therapies, in selected cases, such as muscle relaxants and botulinum toxin, or by excising the excessive muscle fibers.(2,4,5)REFERENCES1.Kebede B, Megersa S.

The contribution of different AMPK subunits to the regulation of cell growth size remains inadequately characterized. Using AMPKγ3 mutant-overexpressing transgenicTg-Prkag3225Qand AMPKγ3-knockout (Prkag3−/−) mice, we investigated the requirement for the AMPKγ3 isoform in functional overload-induced muscle hypertrophy. Although the genetic disruption of the γ3 isoform did not impair muscle growth, control sham-operated AMPKγ3-transgenic mice displayed heavier plantaris muscles in response to overload hypertrophy and underwent smaller mass gain and lowerIgf1expression compared with wild-type littermates. The mTOR signaling pathway was upregulated with functional overload but unchanged between genetically modified animals and wild-type littermates. Differences in AMPK-related signaling pathways between transgenic, knockout, and wild-type mice did not impact muscle hypertrophy. Glycogen content was increased following overload in wild-type mice. In conclusion, our functional, transcriptional, and signaling data provide evidence against the involvement of the AMPKγ3 isoform in the regulation of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Thus, the AMPKγ3 isoform is dispensable for functional overload-induced muscle growth. Mechanical loading can override signaling pathways that act as negative effectors of mTOR signaling and consequently promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy.specific organ plasticityis vital for health and disease and allows the organism to respond to a wide range of stressors. Skeletal muscle, a highly malleable and responsive tissue, is highly adaptive to energy substrate availability, contractile activity, and exercise as well as various other environmental stimuli. Lifestyle interventions such as endurance- and resistance-based exercise programs improve whole body insulin sensitivity in metabolic disease by "

It has long been clear that skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be prevented by inhibiting RNA synthesis. Since 80% of the cell’s total RNA has been estimated to be rRNA, this finding indicates that de novo production of rRNA via transcription of the corresponding genes is important for such hypertrophy to occur. Transcription of rDNA by RNA Pol I is the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, indicating in turn that this biogenesis strongly influences the hypertrophic response. The present minireview focuses on1) a brief description of the key steps in ribosome biogenesis and the relationship of this process to skeletal muscle mass and2) the coordination of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis for growth or atrophy, as exemplified by the intracellular AMPK and mTOR pathways.INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle mass responds in a remarkable manner to alterations in loading and use. Following a single bout of resistance exercise (RE), the rate of muscle protein synthesis increases significantly (52,67), while the rate of degradation is also enhanced but to a less pronounced extent, resulting in a net increase in protein if nutrition is adequate (88,101). This increase is triggered by the convergence of anabolic signaling on the translational machinery, including cascades involving the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) network, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and calcium (Ca2+)-dependent signaling (1,23,31,81).Most of the protein in skeletal muscle consists of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. The generally accepted mechanism underlying muscular adaptation to training, at least with respect to most factors involved, involves a cumulative effect on gene expression (13,69). Thus repeated sessions of muscle overload increase the number of parallel sarcomeres in the fibers present and, thereby, mass and strength as well (57). Such hypertrophy is independent of the proliferation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion (62), in contrast to long-term remodeling and maintenance of skeletal muscle homeostasis, which appear to require satellite cells together with their influence on non-skeletal muscle cells (19,20).It has long been clear that skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be prevented by inhibiting RNA synthesis (26). Since 80% of the cell’s total RNA has been estimated to be rRNA, this finding indicates that de novo production of rRNA via transcription of the corresponding genes is essential for such hypertrophy to occur. Indeed, the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is proportional to its ribonucleic acid (RNA) content (63). Transcription of rDNA by RNA Pol I is the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, indicating in turn that this biogenesis strongly influences the hypertrophic response. Indeed the RNA content of skeletal muscle rises following increased loading (25), and enhanced ribosome bi"

However, it is still unclear whether myonuclear accretion is driven by increased mechanical loading per se, or occurs, at least in part, in response to muscle injury/regeneration. Here, we developed a non-damaging protocol to evaluate contractile activity-induced myonuclear accretion/hypertrophy in physiological conditions.MethodsContractile activity was generated by applying repeated electrical stimuli over the mouse plantar flexor muscles. This method is commonly referred to as NeuroMuscular Electrical Simulation (NMES) in Human. Each NMES training session consisted of 80 isometr"

Cardiac hypertrophy is primarily characterized by excess protein synthesis, increased cardiomyocyte size, and thickened ventricular walls and is a major risk factor that promotes arrhythmia and heart failure. In recent years, cardiomyocyte autophagy has been considered to play a role in controlling the hypertrophic response. However, the beneficial or aggravating role of cardiomyocyte autophagy in cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial. The exact mechanism of cardiomyocyte autophagy in cardiac hypertrophy requires further study. In this review, we summarize the controversies associated with autophagy in cardiac hypertrophy and provide insights into the role of autophagy in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. We conclude that future studies should emphasize the relationship between autophagy and the different stages of cardiac hypertrophy, as well as the autophagic flux and selective autophagy. Autophagy will be a potential therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy.Keywords:autophagy, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac function, cell signaling, autophagic fluxIntroductionThe heart responds to environmental stimuli through a series of responses, including changes in chamber volume, systolic contraction, diastolic relaxation, heart rate, and muscle mass. Physiologic hypertrophy typically occurs during normal responses to healthy exercise or pregnancy. However, pathologic hypertrophy is commonly stimulated by stress or induced by diseases, such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, and neurohormones. Pathologic cardiac hypertrophy plays a compensatory role by increasing cardiac o"

In addition, few aging investigations have examined multiple muscles in the same individuals. This longitudinal investigation compared changes in skeletal muscle size via computed tomography of the quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius), hamstrings (biceps femoris short and long heads, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus), psoas, rectus abdominis, lateral abdominals (obliques and transversus abdominis), and paraspinal muscles (erector spinae and multifidi) of older individuals from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study at baseline and 5.0 ± 0.1 years later (n= 469, 73 ± 3 yr and 78 ± 3 yr, 49% women, 33% black). Skeletal muscle size decreased (P< 0.05) in quadriceps (−3.3%), hamstrings (−5.9%), psoas (−0.4%), and rectus abdominis (−7.0%). The hamstrings and rectus abdominis atrophied approximately twice as much as the quadriceps (P< 0.05), whereas the quadriceps atrophied substantially more than the psoas (P< 0.05). The lateral abdominals (+5.9%) and paraspinals (+4.3%) hypertrophied (P< 0.05) to a similar degree (P> 0.05) over the 5 years. These data suggest that older individuals experience skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy in a muscle group-specific fashion in the eighth decade, a critical time period in the aging process. A broader understanding of muscle group-specific skeletal muscle aging is needed to better guide exercise programs and other interventions that mitigate decrements in physical function with aging.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThese longitudinal analyses of six muscle groups in septuagenarians provide novel information on the muscle group-specific aging process. Although the quadriceps, hamstrings, psoas, and rectus abdominis atrophied with different magnitudes, the lateral abdominals and paraspinals hypertrophied over the 5 years. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the skeletal muscle aging process and highlight the need to complete studies in this area with a muscle-specific focus.INTRODUCTIONIt is well understood that the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, and the development of appropriate countermeasures, are critical issues for the health and independence of aging individuals (1).

This study builds upon previous evidence establishing a gut microbiome‐skeletal muscle axis, identifying exercise‐induced changes in microbiome composition. Metagenomics sequencing of fecal samples from non‐exercise‐trained controls or exercise‐trained mice was conducted. Biodiversity indices indicated exercise training did not change alpha diversity. However, there were notable differences in beta‐diversity between trained and untrained microbiomes. Exercise significantly increased the level of the bacterial speciesMuribaculaceae bacterium DSM 103720. Computation simulation of bacterial growth was used to predict metabolites that accumulate under in silico culture of exercise‐responsive bacteria. We identified acetate and succinate as potential gut microbial metabolites that are produced byMuribaculaceae bacterium, which were then administered to mice during a period of mechanical overload‐induced muscle hypertrophy. Although no differences were observed for the overall muscle growth response to succinate or acetate administration during the first 5 days of mechanical overload‐induced hypertrophy, acetate and succinate increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. When given as post‐biotics, succinate or acetate treatm"

Harmine, a β‐carboline alkaloid found in plants, possesses numerous pharmacological functions, including alleviating cardiac hypertrophy. Similarly, Selenomethionine (SE), a primary organic selenium source, has been shown to mitigate cardiac autophagy and alleviate injury. To explores the therapeutic potential of combining Harmine with SE to treat cardiac hypertrophy. The synergistic effects of SE and harmine against cardiac hypertrophy were assessed in vitro with angiotensin II (AngII)‐induced hypertrophy and in vivo using aMyh6R404Qmouse model. Co‐administration of SE and harmine significantly reduced hypertrophy‐related markers, outperforming monotherapies. Transcriptomic and metabolic profiling revealed substantial alterations in key metabolic and signalling pathways, particularly those involved in energy metabolism. Notably, the combination therapy led to a marked reduction in the activity of key glycolytic enzymes. Importantly, the addition of the glycolysis inhibitor 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose (2‐DG) did not further potentiate these effects, suggesting that the antihypertrophic action is predominantly mediated through glycolytic inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of SE and harmine as a promising combination therapy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.Keywords:cardiac hypertrophy, combination therapy, glycolysis metabolism, harmine, selenomethio"

Thirty-eight young healthy untrained users (n= 20) and nonusers of OC (n= 18) completed a 10-wk supervised progressive resistance training program. Before and after the intervention, a muscle tissue sample was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle for analysis of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) and satellite cell (SC) and myonuclei number using immunohistochemistry, gene expression using PCR, protein expression, and myosin heavy chain composition. Following the training period, quadriceps fCSA (P< 0.05), SCs/type I fiber (P= 0.05), and MURF-1 mRNA (P< 0.01) were significantly increased with no difference between the groups. However, SCs/total fiber and SCs/type II fiber increased in OC users only, and SCs/type II fCSA tended (P= 0.055) to be greater in the OC users. Furthermore, in OC users there were a fiber type shift from myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIx to MHC IIa (P< 0.01), and expression of muscle regulatory factor 4 (MRF4) mRNA (P< 0.001) was significantly greater than in non-OC users. Use of second-generation OCs in young untrained women increased skeletal muscle MRF4 expression and SC number following 10 wk of resistance training compared with nonusers.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThe effect of oral contraceptive use on the skeletal muscle regulatory pathways in response to resistance training has not been investigated previously. Here we present novel data, demonstrating that use of second-generation oral contraceptives in young untrained women increased skeletal muscle regulatory factor 4 expression and satellite cell number following 10 wk of resistance training compared with nonusers.INTRODUCTIONOral contraceptives (OCs) are used by more than 50% of the female population between 20 and 24 yr (30) and are the preferred form of contraception in elite athletes (35). Yet, how OCs influence skeletal muscle is still uncertain.OCs with synthetic estradiol [ethinyl estradiol (EE)] and synthetic progesterone (progestin) suppress and thereby replace endogenous secreted estradiol and progester"

Certain political circles are advocating the implementation of a tax on sugary products to reign in ballooning costs associated with treating the one in three individuals in the United States now classified as obese. Now, this is certainly not the appropriate forum to rant over taxes. But, given the ever emerging liability of obesity and related comorbidities to not only quality of life, but financial solvency of individuals and industries, a discussion apropos the latest scientific findings surrounding this epidemic is deserved.The recent paper by Paturi and Blough et al. (9) “Impaired overload-induced hypertrophy in obese Zucker rat slow-twitch skeletal muscle” has suggested a link between obesity and impaired muscle growth attributed to impaired insulin signaling. Desensitization of the insulin receptor (IR) is a hallmark trait of obesity and is a key factor in the development of the now commonly referred to metabolic syndrome—an aggregation of signs that contribute to the onset of coronary artery disease, stroke, and diabetes. Chronic stimulation of the IR, brought about through elevated circulating levels of insulin, amino acids, and/or inflammatory mediators, all signs associated with the metabolic syndrome, promotes for the ultimate demise of IR function.In addition to its role in promoting the uptake and storage of glucose, the IR plays an indispensable role in the promotion of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The IR, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, promotes for activation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) through binding growth agonists such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1. Most of the messaging transduced through IR/IRS-1 binding is mediated through phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and downstream to Akt, collectively referred to as the IR/PI3K/Akt signaling axis. Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates hamertin (TSC2), a suppressor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1)—an assembly of proteins including mTOR, raptor, and G protein β-subunit-like (GβL or LST8), which together drive skeletal muscle hypertrophy. As a result of TSC2 inhibition, mTORC1 activates key downstream molecules, among which includes p70s6k, a ribosomal associated protein that assists in facilitating protein translation initiation.Interestingly, this cell signaling pathway purportedly can regulate itself, in that activation of p70s6k promotes phosphorylation of the IRS-1 on select Ser/Thr residues, which flags the protein for degradation (10). This negative feedback loop is mediated through mTOR, as administration of rapamycin, a known mTOR inhibitor, rescues IRS-1 from phosphorylation and degradation (11). As such, chronic stimulation of the IR/PI3K/Akt signaling axis through chronic elevations in growth agonists results in the ultimate demise of the signaling pathway, leading to not only deficiencies in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, but perhaps impaired skeletal muscle growth. However, the link between IR/PI3K/Akt dysfunction and skeletal muscle hypertrophy as it relates to obesity and related comorbidities is largely unknown.The paper b"

This remodeling can include alterations in muscle fiber type distribution and/or changes in muscle strength, with or without muscle hypertrophy. Resistance training, ie, mechanical overload, especially, can lead to dramatic increases in muscle mass. The molecular regulation of hypertrophy is highly complex involving several mechanisms including endocrine and paracrine signaling, mechanotransduction, and satellite cells as well as nonmyogenic cells.1The role of satellite cells in the context of muscle overload-induced hypertrophy is of particular interest. Satellite cells derive their name from their unique localization, ie, residing on the surface of the myofiber between the myofiber plasma membrane and its surrounding basal lamina. Transplantation, lineage-tracing, and cell ablation studies have helped cement the satellite cells’ essential role as muscle stem cells, which readily provide new myonuclei for regeneration of multinucleated myofibers after acute injury.2Evidence on the contribution of satellite cells to load-induced hypertrophy only recently emerged. While an initial report indicated that muscle mass gains appear to be possible without the accretion of new myonuclei via fusion of satellite cells,3a subsequent study showed that fusion-competent satellite cells are necessary for robust gains in muscle mass.4In the inaugural issue ofFUNCTION, Murach et al. report that satellite cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are taken up by the myofiber during load-induced hypertrophy and conclude that this process contributes to modulating muscle mass.5The authors performed lineage-labeling studies of adult satellite cells in the mouse and show that the lineage reporter protein is packaged into EVs purified from satellite cell-derived myoblast cultures. These data confirm previous work published by this group.6They next asked whether the EV packaged reporter is taken up by myofibers during load-induced hypertrophy. To distinguish between EV contribution versus satellite cell fusion with the myofiber syncytium, ability of cell fusion was compromised in satellite cells via genetic inactivation of Neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrom Protein (N-WASP), a fusion essential protein. Compared to controls, no increase in myonuclei was detected during the first week of load-induced hypertrophy in single myofibers with N-WASP-satellite cells. Yet, the lineage label of the fusion-compromised satellite cells was detected in the myofiber syncytium. Using a cell culture approach, the authors next asked whether satellite cell-derived EVs can deliver cargo to myotubes. EVs were purified from lineage-labeled satellite cell-derived myoblast cultures and incubated with myotubes. Subsequently, the lineage-label was detected in the myotubes, leading the authors to conclude that satellite cells can communicate with myofibers during load-induced hypertrophy via EVs. This EV-mediated cargo delivery to myofibers parallels the authors’ previous findings on satellite cell-derived EV communication to fibroblasts.6Next, the authors soug"

Published by BMJ.PMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC7813317 PMID:33462041AbstractMasseter hypertrophy (MH) is an uncommon disorder which can cause both aesthetic and functional problems. The most common aetiological factors associated with MH are habit of chewing gum, clenching and/or bruxism. The treatment of MH includes conservative management as well as surgical resection of the enlarged muscle and/or bone. Injection of botulinum toxin type A is a relatively new and minimally invasive method for management of masseter muscle hypertrophy, which offers many advantages over conventional surgical management. This paper reports a case of unilateral MH of unknown origin which was treated with injection of botulinum toxin type A, resulting in satisfactory reduction in the volume of muscle and improvement of facial aesthetics.Keywords:dentistry and oral medicine, oral and maxillofacial surgeryBackgroundMasseter hypertrophy (MH) is an uncommon disorder, characterised by benign enlargement of the masseter muscle volume. It has the highest incidence in the second and third decades of life, with no sex predilection.1MH may result in aesthetic and functional disturbances. It causes prominence of muscle, leading to square or rectangular facial form. Functional problems associated with MH are due to the altered tone of the hypertrophied muscle, which may lead to protrusion of jaw, pain and headache.2The aetiology of MH is obscure and is most commonly related to the grinding habits of jaw that includes excessive gum chewing, clenching and bruxism. When no aetiological factor is identified, MH is considered to be idiopathic in nature.3Idiopathic masseter muscle hypertrophy (IMMH) was first described by Legg.4People suffering from psychological disorders or emotional disturbances that impact the proprioception and ability to maintain the tone of the masseter muscle are at a higher risk of developing IMMH.2MH can involve either one or both of the masseter muscles; however, bilateral MH is more common; accounting for 60% of the cases.5 6The present paper describes a case of idiopathic unilateral masseter muscle hypertrophy which was successfully treated non-surgically by injecting botulinum toxin type A.Case presentationA 22-year-old female patient reported to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic with the primary symptom of painless swelling over left lower third of the face, since past 2 years. The primary symptom of the patient was due to the aesthetic concerns and there was no functional deficit. The swelling was gradual in onset and was not associated with pain or fever. The patient reported no deleterious or parafunctional oral habit. Also, there was no history of trauma or psychological distress. On extraoral examination, the swelling was localised to the left angle region of the mandible and was non-tender on palpation (figure 1). When the patient was asked to clench her teeth the bulk of the masseter muscle was visible and the swelling was firm in consistency. On intraoral examination, there was no sign of odontogenic infection or occlusal prematurity. Mouth opening was adequate. No growth was seen in the left posterior region of oral cavity.Figure 1.Open in a new tabExtraoral photographs showing swelling over the left angle of mandible region on (A) frontal view, (B) right and (C) left profile view.InvestigationsPanoramic radiograph was done to rule out any bony lesion in the angle and ramus region of the mandible.

Twenty-six men (23 ± 2 yr; means ± SD) were randomized to daily intake of oral salbutamol (16 mg/day; RES+SAL) or placebo (RES) during 11 wk of full-body resistance training 3 times/wk. Mean power output during 10-s maximal cycling increased more (P= 0.027) in RES+SAL (+12%) than in RES (+7%), whereas peak power output increased similarly (RES+SAL: +8%; RES: +7%;P= 0.400). Quadriceps dynamic peak torque and maximal voluntary isometric torque increased by 13 and 14% (P≤ 0.001) in RES+SAL and 13 and 13% (P≤ 0.001) in RES, respectively. Myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoform distribution transitioned from MHCI and MHCIIx toward MHCIIa in RES+SAL (P= 0.002), but not in RES (P= 0.323).

Acute resistance exercise typically elevates type I and type II SC content 24–96 h post exercise in healthy young males, although comparable research in females is lacking. We aimed to elucidate whether sex-based differences exist in fiber type-specific SC content after resistance exercise in the untrained (UT) and trained (T) states. Ten young males (23.0 ± 4.0 yr) and females (23.0 ± 4.8 yr) completed an acute bout of resistance exercise before and after 8 wk of whole body resistance training. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis immediately before and 24 and 48 h after each bout to determine SC and myonuclear content by immunohistochemistry. Males had greater SC associated with type II fibers (P≤ 0.03). There was no effect of acute resistance exercise on SC content in either fiber type (P≥ 0.58) for either sex; however, training increased SC in type II fibers (P< 0.01) irrespective of sex. The change in mean 0–48 h type II SC was positively correlated with muscle fiber hypertrophy in type II fibers (r= 0.47;P= 0.035). Furthermore, the change in myonuclei per fiber was positively correlated with type I and type II fiber hypertrophy (bothr= 0.68;P< 0.01). Our results suggest that SC responses to acute and chronic resistance exercise are similar in males and females and that SC and myonuclear accretion is related to training-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe demonstrate that training-induced increase in SC content in type II fibers and myonuclear content in type I and II fibers is similar between males and females. Furthermore, these changes are related to the extent of muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, SC and myonuclear accretion appear to contribute to muscle hypertrophy irrespective of sex, highlighting the importance of these muscle stem cells in human skeletal muscle growth.INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle is a multinucleated, postmitotic tissue that displays a remarkable remodeling capacity in response to contractile activity such as the ability to hypertrophy with resistance training or atrophy in response to periods of inactivity/disuse (1). During recovery from exercise (especially resistance exercise), satellite cells (SC) undergo proliferation, differentiation, and, on fusion with existing myofibers, provide new myonuclei for growing muscle cells (2)."

It is among the most extensively studied biological process in diseases that affect the heart. Reversal of cardiac enlargement, either by pharmacological treatment or removal of an overload stimulus by other means, is a major treatment objective to prolong and improve quality of life. Examination of the molecular mechanisms, by which regression of hypertrophy occurs, is an important research objective in the development of new therapies that have not been as extensively studied as cardiac hypertrophy. Our knowledge is also severely lacking regarding potential sex differences in how hypertrophy regresses since the vast majority of animal studies have been conducted in males (1). To this point, a major lesson that has been learned is that regression of heart enlargement is not simply the opposite of cardiac hypertrophy, and perhaps we should not be surprised that the sexes respond differently to these pathological processes, as clearly presented in the report by Muehleman et al. (2).In this issue of theAmerican Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology, Muehleman et al. (2) examine regression of cardiac hypertrophy in isoproterenol (Iso)-treated and angiotensin II (ANG II)-treated mice with particular emphasis on the role of sex in this process. In both hypertrophy models, exposure to the initiating stimulus was for 7 days, followed by discontinuation of drug treatment and examination of regression at 1, 4, and 7 days. The extent of left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy was similar with both stimuli and in both sexes, ∼30%. Regression of cardiac mass also followed a similar timeline in both males and females after discontinuing Iso. Hypertrophy regression was also noted in ANG II-treated males but not in females within the 7-day regression period. With advancements in expressed gene analysis using RNA sequencing and in bioinformatics tools to infer regulatory networks upstream of gene-expression data based on causal networks derived from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, these authors have undertaken a detailed systematic approach to identify molecular events occurring in the regression of hypertrophy that provides some novel insights. Just as gene and phenotypic characteristics of myocardial hypertrophy are disease dependent (i.e., hypertension, obesity, and valvular stenosis), it may be expected that regression mechanisms would similarly vary because of the initiating hypertrophic stimulus. Understanding these mechanisms could potentially advance the therapeutic strategies to reverse remodel hypertrophied failing hearts. Older studies have shown that the early hypertrophic response to Iso is an increase in myocyte mass (protein/RNA content), with delayed increases in DNA and hydroxyproline, indicating complex temporal responses of cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Regression of ventricular hypertrophy with Iso withdrawal showed a return to control of myocyte-specific RNA and protein content without decreases in Iso-induced elevations of DNA and hydroxyproline, suggesting differential myocyte- and nonmyocyte-specific responses, and point to a need for ce"

Therefore, HSF1-associated stress response may play a key role in loading-associated skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of HSF1-deficiency on skeletal muscle hypertrophy caused by overloading. Functional overloading on the left soleus was performed by cutting the distal tendons of gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles for 4 weeks. The right muscle served as the control. Soleus muscles from both hindlimbs were dissected 2 and 4 weeks after the operation. Hypertrophy of soleus muscle in HSF1-null mice was partially inhibited, compared with that in wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice. Absence of HSF1 partially attenuated the increase of muscle"

These studies led us to hypothesize that MuRF1 similarly inhibits insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-mediated physiological cardiomyocyte growth. We identified two lines of evidence to support this hypothesis: IGF-I stimulation of cardiac-derived cells with MuRF1 knockdown1) exhibited an exaggerated hypertrophy and,2) conversely, increased MuRF1 expression-abolished IGF-I-dependent cardiomyocyte growth. Enhanced hypertrophy with MuRF1 knockdown was accompanied by increases in Akt-regulated gene expression. Unexpectedly, MuRF1 inhibition of this gene expression profile was not a result of differences in p-Akt. Instead, we found that MuRF1 inhibits total protein levels of Akt, GSK-3β (downstream of Akt), and mTOR while limiting c-Jun protein expression, a mechanism recently shown to govern Akt, GSK-3β, and mTOR activities and expression. These findings establish that MuRF1 inhibits IGF-I signaling by restricting c-Jun activity, a novel mechanism recently identified in the context of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Since IGF-I regulates exercise-mediated physiological cardiac growth, we challenged MuRF1−/−and MuRF1-Tg+ mice and their wild-type sibling controls to 5 wk of voluntary wheel running. MuRF1−/−cardiac growth was increased significantly over wild-type control; conversely, the enhanced exercise-induced cardiac growth was lost in MuRF1-Tg+ animals. These studies demonstrate that MuRF1-dependent attenuation of IGF-I signaling via c-Jun is applicable in vivo and establish that further understanding of this novel mechanism may be crucial in the development of therapies targeting IGF-I signaling.muscle ring finger-1(MuRF1) is a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase localized to multiple regions of the cardiomyocyte, where it affects the function and stability of numerou"

Muscle wasting, characteristic of several pathological states associated with local or systemic inflammation, has been for long considered to rely on the alteration of myofiber intracellular pathways regulated by both hormones and cytokines, eventually leading to impaired anabolism and increased protein breakdown. However, there are increasing evidences that even alterations of the myogenic/regenerative program play a role in the onset of muscle wasting, even though the precise mechanisms involved are far from being fully elucidated. The comprehension of the links potentially occurring between impaired myogenesis and increased catabolism would allow the definition of effective strategies aimed at counteracting muscle wasting. The first part of this review gives an overview of skeletal muscle intracellular pathways determining fiber size, while the second part considers the cells and the regulatory pathways involved in the myogenic program. In both parts are discussed the evidences supporting the role of inflammation in impairing muscle homeostasis and myogenesis, potentially determining muscle atrophy.1. IntroductionSkeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in human body, except in obese patients, and is involved in several physiological functions. Indeed, glucose uptake and metabolism take place primarily in the skeletal muscle, a tissue prone to adaptation in size by means of both hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The former relies on the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation rates, while the latter involves the myogenic process that is in charge of regulating myocyte turnover as well as of supporting the rapid regeneration following injury.The counterpart of muscle hypertrophy is muscle atrophy, even defined as sarcopenia, that naturally occurs in physiological conditions, such as aging [1]. Beyond aging, muscle wasting is a feature associated with several pathological states and chronic diseases such as immobilization following fractures or bed rest, malnutrition, cancer, CHF, CKD, COPD, burns, muscular dystrophies, AIDS, sepsis, and immune disorders [2]. Muscle depletion has important implications, exercise intolerance and inability to manage daily activities that eventually translate into poor quality of life. Most of the above mentioned pathological conditions are associated with variable degrees of local and/or systemic chronic inflammation, an element that could play a relevant role in the onset of muscle wasting [2]. Indeed, inflammation is considered one of the diagnostic hallmarks of cachexia, a wasting condition that often occurs in chronic diseases [3].The aim of this review is to summarize the evidences supporting the role of inflammation, associated with several illnesses, in impairing muscle homeostasis and myogenesis, leading to muscle atrophy.2.

Here we examine whether the soleus muscles of the lean Zucker (LZ) and insulin-resistant obese Zucker (OZ) rat exhibit differences in their ability to undergo muscle hypertrophy following 8 wk of mechanical overload. Four-week-old male LZ (n= 5) and OZ (n= 5) rats underwent unilateral surgical ablation of the gastrocnemius muscle while the contralateral hindlimb was used as an internal control. Mechanical overload increased soleus muscle wet weight (LZ 57% and OZ 33%, respectively;P< 0.05) and average type 1 fiber cross-sectional area (LZ 32% and OZ 5%, respectively;P< 0.05) in LZ and OZ rats, while the magnitude of these increases was greater in the LZ animals (P< 0.05). The reduced degree of muscle hypertrophy observed in the OZ animals was associated with decreases in the ability of the OZ soleus muscle to phosphorylate p70s6kThr 389and mTOR, while phosphorylation of p70s6kThr 389was increased in the LZ overloaded soleus by 83% (P< 0.05). The amount of Tuberin/TSC2 phosphorylation, an inhibitor of mTOR, was unchanged in the LZ soleus after overload while it was increased (68.3%,P< 0.05) in OZ animals. Conversely, AMPK phosphorylation was decreased in the LZ (−22.77%,P< 0.05) but increased (57%,P< 0.05) in the OZ soleus with overload. Taken together, these data suggest that IR or other related comorbidities may impair the ability of the soleus to activate mTOR signaling and undergo load-induced muscle hypertrophy.insulin resistance(IR) and the development of type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (DM) is an emerging epidemic in Western cultures that is thought to afflict over 180 million people worldwide (13).

Compared with their counterparts in trunk and limbs, craniofacial muscles are of distinct embryonic origins, which might consequently lead to different growth patterns and regenerative potential. In this study, rat levator veli palatini muscle and masseter muscle were compared with tibialis anterior muscle in their response to exogenous Wnt7a stimulus, which has been proved effective in promoting muscle regeneration in the limbs. Histological, cellular and molecular analyses were performed both under basal condition and after a single dose injection of recombinant human Wnt7a. Under basal condition, levator veli palatini muscle demonstrated considerably more satellite cells than the others. After Wnt7a administration, regeneration-related activities, including satellite cell expansion, myofiber hyperplasia and hypertrophy were generally observed in all three muscles, but with obvious differences in the extent. The composition of fast/slow myofibers underwent substantial alterations, and the pattern varied among the three muscles. Location-specific alterations in the expression level of core components in planar cell polarity pathway, Akt/mTOR pathway and myostatin pathway were also observed. In conclusion, both craniofacial and limb muscles could be effectively expanded by exogenous Wnt7a stimulus, but muscle-to-muscle variations in response patterns existed.IntroductionSkeletal muscle is highly coordinated and malleable tissue and compromises up to 40% of the total body mass1. With intrinsic properties to withstand stress and produce force, skeletal muscle supports body posture and drives body movements, ranging from sudden and intensive limb movements like jumping and kicking, to continuous and mild activities like respiration, speech and expressions in the craniofacial region2. These critical functions could be impaired when pathological alterations occur to skeletal muscle.The most studied skeletal muscle degen"

The objective of this study was to establish novel relationships between baseline muscle features and/or their PRT-induced change in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies with hypertrophy outcomes. Multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for sex were performed on phenotypic data from older adults (n= 48 participants, 70.8 ± 4.5 yr) completing 14 wk of PRT. Results show that baseline muscle size associates with growth regardless of hypertrophy outcome measure [fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), β = −0.76, Adj.P< 0.01; thigh muscle area by computed tomography (CT), β = −0.75, Adj.P< 0.01; dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) thigh lean mass, β = −0.47, Adj.P< 0.05]. Furthermore, loosely packed collagen organization (CO, β = −0.44, Adj.P< 0.05) and abundance of CD11b+/CD206− immune cells (β = −0.36, Adj.P= 0.10) were negatively associated with whole muscle hypertrophy, with a significant sex interaction on the latter. In addition, a composite hypertrophy score generated using all three measures reinforces significant fiber level findings that changes in myonuclei (MN) (β = 0.67, Adj.P< 0.01), changes in immune cells (β = 0.48, Adj.P< 0.05; both CD11b+/CD206+and CD11b+/CD206− "

The aim of the present study is to identify the role of perlecan in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and myostatin signaling, with and without mechanical stress, using a mouse model (Hspg2−/−-Tg) deficient in skeletal muscle perlecan. We found that myosin heavy chain (MHC) type IIb fibers in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of Hspg2−/−-Tg mice had a significantly increased fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) compared to control (WT-Tg) mice. Hspg2−/−-Tg mice also had an increased number of type IIx fibers in the TA muscle. Myostatin and its type I receptor (ALK4) expression was substantially decreased in the Hspg2−/−-Tg TA muscle. Myostatin-induced Smad activation was also reduced in a culture of myotubes from the Hspg2−/−-Tg muscle, suggesting that myostatin expression and its signaling were decreased in the Hspg2−/−-Tg muscle. To examine the effects of mechanical overload or unload on fast and slow muscles in Hspg2−/−-Tg mice, we performed tenotomy of the plantaris (fast) muscle and the soleus (slow) muscle. Mechanical overload on the plantaris muscle of Hspg2−/−-Tg mice significantly increased wet weights compared to those of control mice, and unloaded plantaris muscles of Hspg2−/−-Tg mice caused less decrease in wet weights compared to those of control mice. The decrease in myostatin expression was significantly profound in the overloaded plantaris muscle of Hspg2−/−-Tg mice, compared with that of control mice. In contrast, overloading the soleus muscle caused no changes in either type of muscle. These results suggest that perlecan is critical for maintaining fast muscle mass and fiber composition, and for regulating myostatin signaling.Keywords:Perlecan, Muscle hypertrophy, Mechanical stress, Myostatin1.

We aimed to investigate the significance of apelin signaling in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to physiological stress. Apelin knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) by treadmill running. The effects of apelin on energy metabolism were studied in primary mouse skeletal muscle myotubes and cardiomyocytes. Apelin increased mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial coupling efficiency in myotubes and promoted the expression of mitochondrial genes both in primary myotubes and cardiomyocytes. HIIT induced mild concentric cardiac hypertrophy in WT mice, whereas eccentric growth was observed in the left ventricles of apelin KO mice. HIIT did not affect myofiber size in skeletal muscles of WT mice but decreased the myofiber size in apelin KO mice. The decrease in myofiber size resulted from a fiber type switch toward smaller slow-twitch type I fibers. The increased proportion of slow-twitch type"

Mitochondrial quality control encompasses the dynamics of the biogenesis and remodeling of mitochondria, characterized by the constant fission and fusion of mitochondria in response to metabolic stressors. However, the roles of mitochondrial fission or fusion in muscle hypertrophy and atrophy remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether mitochondrial fusion and fission events are influenced by muscle hypertrophy or atrophy stimulation. Twenty‐six male F344 rats were randomly assigned to a control group or were subjected to up to 14 days of either plantaris overload (via tenotomy of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles; hypertrophy group) or hindlimb cast immobilization (atrophy group). After 14 days of treatment, plantaris muscle samples were collected to determine the expression levels of mitochondrial fusion‐ and fission‐related proteins. Muscle weight and total muscle protein content increased following plantaris overload in the hypertrophy group, but decreased following immobilization for 14 days in the atrophy group. In the hypertrophied muscle, the level of activated dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1), phosphorylated at Ser616, significantly increased by 25.8% (p= 0.014). Moreover, the protein expression level of mitochondrial fission factor significantly decreased by 36.5% in the hypertrophy group compared with that of the control group (p= 0.017). In contrast, total Drp1 level significantly decreased in the atrophied plantaris muscle (p= 0.011). Our data suggest that mitochondrial fission events may be influenced by both muscle hypertrophy and atrophy stimulation, and that mitochondrial fission‐ related protein Drp1 plays an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle in response to mechanical stimulation.Keywords:atrophy, Drp1, hypertrophy, mitochondrial quality controlIn this study, we explored the role of mitochondrial dynamics‐related proteins, especially those involved in fission and fusion of the mitochondria, on muscle mass regulation in the context of hypertrophy and atrophy. To this end, we established a rat model of muscle hypertrophy using plantaris muscle overload with synergist ablation and a rat model of muscle atrophy by fixing the knee and ankle joints with casts for up to 14 days. Muscle weight and total protein content were increased and decreased by hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, as expected. Moreover, the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 was activated and translocated from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane under hypertrophy. Opposite effects were observed under atrophy.1. INTRODUCTIONThe skeletal muscle is characterized by high plasticity, and regulation of muscle mass is primarily determined by protein metabolism. Chronic deprivation of mechanical stimulation to the muscles, such as that induced by denervation, bed rest, and immobilization, leads to muscle atrophy owing to a decline in protein synthesis and a relative increase in protein degradation (Krawiec et al.,2005; Lecker et al.,1999). In contrast, hypertrophic stimulation such as electric stimulation and overload activates protein synthesis. Although the link between mechanical signals and muscle mass regulation has been recognized, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.Mitochondria in the skeletal muscle are essential for maintaining metabolic plasticity and function. Recent studies have shown that mitochondria play key roles in mediating muscle atrophy (Favoro et al.,2019.; Iqbal et al.,2013; Picard e"

However, the role miRNAs play in controlling the growth and adaptation of post-mitotic musculature is less clear. Here, we show that inhibition of the established pro-myogenic regulator miR-206 can promote hypertrophy and increased protein synthesis in post-mitotic cells of the myogenic lineage. We have previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is a target of miR-206 in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. We confirmed that inhibition of miR-206 de-repressed HDAC4 accumulation in cultured myotubes. Importantly, inhibition of HDAC4 activity by valproic acid or sodium butyrate prevented hypertrophy of myogenic cells otherwise induced by inhibition of miR-206. To test the significance of miRNA-206 as a regulator of skeletal muscle massin vivo, we designed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV6 vectors) expressing miR-206, or a miR-206 “sponge,” featuring repeats of a validated miR-206 target sequence.

Previously performed whole body radiographs, plasma biochemistry results and complete blood count revealed had no significant abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a circumferential caudal esophageal thickening. The animal received supportive care until euthanasia was performed 6 weeks later. Caudal esophageal smooth muscle hypertrophy was diagnosed on necropsy. This case indicates that regurgitation can occur in rabbits and advanced imaging can investigate the underlying cause.Keywords:computed tomography, esophageal stricture, gastrointestinal disorder, rabbit, vomitingRegurgitation, a passive retrograde movement of ingesta to the upper esophageal sphincter, is a clinical sign of an esophageal disorder [12]. Esophageal disorders are somewhat common in the dog and have been described as rare in the cat [4]. Vomiting, an active process of ingesta from the stomach (whereas regurgitated material rarely reaches the stomach), must be carefully differentiated from regurgitation when an animal is presented for either clinical sign [12]. Regurgitation can be a clinical sign of esophageal foreign body, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, megaesophagus (with numerous differential diagnoses potentially causing this anatomic abnormality), esophageal dysmotility, and esophageal neoplasia [12]. While it is frequently noted that rabbits cannot vomit, no mention of regurgitation is made when discussing rabbit gastrointestinal disorders [3,7,8,11].An approximately five-year-old male neutered Dutch rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)was referred with a 7 to 8- month history of regurgitation, bruxism, intermittent anorexia, and progressive lethargy. The referring veterinarian diagnosed and treated the rabbit for cuterebriasis in the conjunctiva of the right eye 9 months prior to referral. Approximately two weeks after this diagnosis, the rabbit returned to the primary veterinarian for lethargy and anorexia. The rabbit was a consistent weight at 1.3 kg with a body condition score of 4/9 and was being offered its typical and appropriate diet of approximately free choice timothy hay with one cup of leafy green vegetables and one-quarter cup of rabbit specific pellets per day. Despite conjunctival swelling remaining, an anesthetized ocular examination revealed no further abnormalities. Whole body radiographs revealed a mild to moderate amount of gas in the small intestinal loops, which may have suggested ileus. A biochemistry profile was within normal limits. The rabbit was started on syringe feedings with a critical care mixture (10 mlthree times a day, Oxbow Animal Health, Murdock, NE, U.S.A.). Treatment with metoclopramide (0.3 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hr; 1 mg/ml, compounded at Pet Apothecary, Milwaukee, WI) and meloxicam (0.4 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hr; 1.5 mg/ml, Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim, Duluth, GA, U.S.A.) led to a gradual improvement in the rabbit’s appetite and attitude over the next two months, although the bruxism continued and the rabbit’s appetite for hay and cecotrophy never returned.Despite the noted improvements, one to two months following theCuterebrasp. larva removal, the rabbit began to regurgitate.

Expression profiling by microarray was performed on the plantaris muscle subjected to 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days of hypertrophy or regrowth following 2 wk of hind-limb suspension. We identified 97 differentially expressed genes (≥2-fold increase or ≥50% decrease compared with control muscle) that were conserved during the two forms of muscle growth. The vast majority (∼90%) of the differentially expressed genes was upregulated and occurred at a single time point (64 out of 86 genes), which most often was on the first day of the time course. Microarray analysis from the conserved upregulated genes showed a set of genes related to contractile apparatus and stress response atday 1, including three genes involved in mechanotransduction and four genes encoding heat shock proteins. Our analysis further identified three cell cycle-related genes atdayand several genes associated with"

Generalised masticatory muscle hypertrophy may affect the temporalis muscle, masseters and medial pterygoids in a variety of combinations. Masseteric hypertrophy may present as either unilateral or bilateral painless swelling of unknown origin in the region of angle of mandible. It is a relatively rare condition and presents a diagnostic dilemma. While the history and clinical examination are important in differentiating this benign condition from parotid or dental pathology, they cannot necessarily exclude rare malignant lesion within the muscle. Advanced imaging modalities like CT and MRI are essential to confirm the diagnosis. Here the authors are reporting a unique case of masseter muscle hypertrophy along with medial pterygoid hypertrophy which was missed clinically but confirmed using CT and MRI.BackgroundHypertrophy of muscle refers to an increase in size of individual muscle fibres.1Masticatory muscle hypertrophy can affect all the muscles of mastication, several muscles or just one muscle. It can occur either bilaterally or unilaterally, and most commonly the masseter muscles alone are affected. The involved muscles, which are variably enlarged and can be up to three times the normal size, are otherwise normal on all imaging studies.2Several case reports on combined hypertrophy of temporalis and masseter muscles were published3–5but concurrent occurrence of hypertrophy of masseter and medial pterygoid muscles is very rare.Masseter muscle hypertrophy (MMH) may present as unilateral or bilateral, benign increase in size of masseter muscle. Its aetiology remains unexplained. It is most commonly seen in late adolescence and early adulthood, affects both males and females but has slight male predominance.6Very little information concerning this entity has appeared in dental literature because MMH in itself is only occasionally associated with dental problems such as attrition, periodontal breakdown or temperomandibular joint problem. Unilateral or bilateral hypertrophy of the masseter muscle is characterised by an increase in the volume of the muscle mass.7Clinically, patient may present with the complaint of unaesthetic appearance due to facial asymmetry or ‘square’ face appearance. Some patients complain of pain, headache, muscle stress, trismus and intermittent masticatory claudication.8The radiographic findings associated with MMH are the bone spurs at the angle of mandible6or flaring of mandibular angle2and hyperostosis of mandibular ramus.9CT and MRI scans provide useful diagnostic information regarding this condition.2810This entity must be carefully differentiated from unilateral compensatory hypertrophy (due to hypertrophy or hyperplasia in the contralateral side), masseter tumour, salivary gland disease, parotid tumour, parotid inflammatory disease, masseter muscle intrinsic myopathy,8lipoma, vascular tumours, benign and malignant mandible tumours6and metabolic disorders.1Case presentationA 19-year-old male patient reported with a chief complaint of asymmetry of face due to swelling on lower left back tooth region since 4 years.History revealed that initially the swelling was smaller in size and became prominent over a period of 4 years. No history of any trauma, pain, discomfort, altered sensation and increase or decrease in salivary flow was elicited. There was no relevant family and medical history. However,"

While analysis of mixed fiber samples predominates and holds value, increasing attention has been directed toward studying proteins segregated by fiber type, a methodological distinction termed “fiber type-specific.” Fiber type-specific protein studies have the advantage of uncovering key molecular effects that are often missed in mixed fiber homogenate studies but also require greater time and resource-intensive methods, particularly when applied to human muscle. This review summarizes and compares current methods used for fiber type-specific protein analysis, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages for human muscle studies, in addition to recent advances in these techniques. These methods can be grouped into three categories based on the initial processing of the tissue:1) muscle-specific fiber homogenates,2) cross sections of fiber bundles, and3) isolated single fibers, with various subtechniques for performing fiber type identification and protein quantification. The relative implementation for each unique methodological approach is analyzed from 83 fiber type-specific studies of proteins in live human muscle found in the literature to date. These studies have investigated several proteins involved in a wide range of cellular functions that are important to muscle tissue. The second half of this review summarizes key findings from this ensemble of fiber type-specific human protein studies. We highlight examples of where this analytical approach has helped to improve understanding of important physiological topics such as insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, muscle fatigue, and adaptation to different exercise programs.INTRODUCTIONHuman skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue composed of multiple fiber types (FT) that are primarily categorized based on their contractile function. Beyond the basic popular designations of “slow-twitch” versus “fast-twitch” fibers, a spectrum of multiple human FT exists as determined by which of the three myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms is expressed within a single fiber (120). The myosin molecular motor formed by each MHC isoform operates at a different speed: MHC I is the slowest isoform, MHC IIa is categorized as fast, and MHC IIx is even faster (“ultra-fast”). At the cellular level, there are three pure FT that express only a single MHC isoform and additional hybrid FT that express multiple MHC isoforms: MHC I/IIa, MHC IIa/IIx, MHC I/IIx, and MHC I/IIa/IIx (67,86). Besides their contractile properties, slow-twitch (MHC I) and fast-twitch (MHC II) fibers have other significantly different attributes including their metabolism, glycogen content, and mitochondrial abundance (120). The relative abundance of each FT in skeletal muscle varies significantly between individuals, depends on numerous factors such as exercise history, age, and health status (2,7,9,68,83,149), and changes in response to chronic exercise training or disu"

The pathophysiology of hypertrophy is complex and multifactorial, as it touches on several cellular and molecular systems. Understanding the molecular background of cardiac hypertrophy is essential in order to protect the myocardium from pathological remodeling, or slow down the destined progression to heart failure. In this review we highlight the most important molecular aspects of cardiac hypertrophic growth in light of the currently available published research data.MeSH Keywords:Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Cell Adhesion MoleculesEtiology and RisksHypertrophic growth of the heart is an adaptive response to hemodynamic stress, which is believed to have a compensatory role to enhance cardiac performance and diminish ventricular wall tension and oxygen consumption [1]. Physiological hypertrophy of the heart can ensue as a result of exercise or pregnancy, and is deemed mild and/or reversible [2,3]. However, in the presence of chronic stressful conditions such as hypertension and valvular disease, a form of pathological hypertrophy develops, which is characterized by excessive increase in ventricular dimensions, accompanied by myocardial dysfunction and fibrosis [4,5]. These are foreboding signs of the development heart failure and pathological remodeling [6]. Additionally, myocardial supply-demand mismatch secondary to increased myocardial oxygen consumption of the hypertrophic heart further predisposes to multiple cardiovascular ailments, including arrhythmias, myocardial infar"

As it has been reported that the lactate administration induces muscle hypertrophy, the stimulation of GPR81 has been suggested to mediate muscle hypertrophy. To clarify the contribution of GPR81 activation in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, in the present study, we investigated the effect of GPR81 agonist administration on skeletal muscle mass in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control group and GPR81 agonist-administered group that received oral administration of the specific GPR81 agonist 3-Chloro-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (CHBA). In both fast-twitch plantaris and slow-twitch soleus muscles of mice, the protein expression of GPR81 was observed. Oral administration of CHBA to mice significantly increased absolute muscle weight and muscle weight relative to body weight in the two muscles. Moreover, both absolute and relative muscle protein content in the two muscles were significantly increased by CHBA administration. CHBA administration also significantly upregulated the phosphorylation level of p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK). These observations suggest that activation of GRP81 stimulates increased the mass of two types of skeletal muscle in micein vivo. Lactate receptor GPR81 may positively affect skeletal muscle mass through activation of ERK pathway.Keywords:Skeletal muscle, G protein-coupled receptor 81, Muscle mass, p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, p90 ribosomal S6 kinaseIntroductionSkeletal muscle exhibits high plasticity and changes its mass in response to external stimuli. It is well known that mechanical loading induced by resistance training is a typical stimulus for skeletal muscle hypertrophy [1]. It is generally accepted that skeletal muscle mass is highly regulated by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation [2]. The protein synthesis in skeletal muscle has been suggested to be mediated by anabolic signals, such as p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and its downstream target p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) [3]. In skeletal muscle cells, the ERK/p90RSK signaling pathway is activated by mechanical loading [4] and has been suggested to be involved in mechanical loading-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy [5].

The present study aimed to determine whether a previously strength-trained leg (mem-leg) would respond better to a period of strength training than a previously untrained leg (con-leg). Nine men and 10 women performed unilateral strength training (T1) for 10 wk, followed by 20 wk of detraining (DT) and a 5-wk bilateral retraining period (T2). Muscle biopsies were taken before and after each training period and analyzed for myonuclear number, fiber volume, and cross-sectional area (CSA). Ultrasound and one repetition of maximum leg extension were performed to determine muscle thickness (MT) and strength. CSA (~17%), MT (~10%), and strength (~20%) increased during T1 in the mem-leg. However, the myonuclear number and fiber volume did not change. MT and CSA returned to baseline values during DT, but strength remained elevated (~60%), supporting previous findings of a long-lasting motor learning effect. MT and strength increased similarly in the mem-leg and con-leg during T2, whereas CSA, fiber volume, and myonuclear number remained unaffected. In conclusion, training response during T2 did not di"

These adaptations are supported by the action of muscle stem cells (MuSCs), which are regulated, in part, by fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and circulating factors delivered through capillaries. It is unclear if middle-aged males and females have similar adaptations to resistance training at the cellular level. To address this gap, 27 (13 males, 14 females) middle-aged (40–64 yr) adults participated in 10 wk of whole body resistance training with dietary counseling. Muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis pre- and posttraining. Type II fiber cross-sectional area increased similarly with training in both sexes (P= 0.014). MuSC content was not altered with training; however, training increased PDGFRα+/CD90+FAP content (P< 0.0001) and reduced PDGFRα+/CD90−FAP content (P= 0.044), independent of sex. The number of CD31+capillaries per fiber also increased similarly in both sexes (P< 0.05). These results suggest that muscle fiber hypertrophy, stem/progenitor cell, and capillary adaptations are similar between middle-aged males and females in response to whole body resistance training.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe demonstrate th"

Therefore, it is important to pursue a greater understanding of the mechanisms that dictate skeletal muscle adaptation. In this review, we propose that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) comprise a critical regulatory node in the orchestration of adaptive responses in skeletal muscle. While RBPs have broadly pleiotropic molecular functions, our discussion is constrained at the outset by observations from hibernating animals, which suggest that RBP regulation of RNA stability and its impact on translational reprogramming is a key component of skeletal muscle response to anabolic and catabolic stimuli. We discuss the limited data available on the expression and functions of RBPs in adult skeletal muscle in response to disuse, aging, and exercise. A model is proposed in which dynamic changes in RBPs play a central role in muscle adaptive processes through their differential effects on mRNA stability. While limited, the currently available data suggest that understanding how adaptive (and maladaptive) changes in the expression of RBPs regulate mRNA stability in skeletal muscle could be an informative and productive research area for finding new strategies to limit atrophy and promote hypertrophy.INTRODUCTIONThe maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is important for overall health outcomes, especially in the context of aging (34,66), critical illness (65), and injury (4,78). Muscle mass is ultimately dictated by the rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation (54), and understanding the molecular mechanisms governing this balance is key to developing therapies for clinical populations, as well as for optimizing muscle growth for athletic performance and general health. The translation of mRNA into protein offers several mechanistic focal points at which adaptive mechanisms can impart changes in protein synthesis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) exert important posttranscriptional influences at each of these points that can dictate rates and profiles of protein synthesis (40,73). However, while considerable inroads have been made in understanding the roles of RBPs in myogenesis (6,9,10) and particular forms of muscle disease [(8,87), and see Apponi et al. (5) for a detailed review], there has been little research focused on the role of RBPs in adult muscle adaptation. Since muscle cells (myofibers) are terminally differentiated, and a majority of the adaptation to hypertrophic or atrophic stimuli is due to changes in the existing myofib"

Observational studies suggest that low 25[OH]D correlates with functional recovery of skeletal muscle following eccentric contractions in humans and crush injury in rats. However, a definitive association is yet to be established. To address this gap in knowledge in relation to damage repair, a randomised, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 20 males with insufficient concentrations of serum 25(OH)D (45 ± 25 nmol/l). Prior to and following 6 wk of supplemental vitamin D3(4,000 IU/day) or placebo (50 mg of cellulose), participants performed 20 × 10 damaging eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, with peak torque measured over the following 7 days of recovery. Parallel experimentation using isolated human skeletal muscle-derived myoblast cells from biopsies of 14 males with low serum 25(OH)D (37 ± 11 nmol/l) were subjected to mechanical wound injury, which enabled corresponding in vitro studies of muscle repair, regeneration, and hypertrophy in the presence and absence of 10 or 100 nmol 1α,25(OH)2D3.Supplemental vitamin D3increased serum 25(OH)D and improved recovery of peak torque at 48 h and 7 days postexercise. In vitro, 10 nmol 1α,25(OH)2D3improved muscle cell migration dynamics and resulted in improved myotube fusion/differentiation at the biochemical, morphologic"

Specifically, it has been widely proposed that mechanical loads activate signaling through mTORC1 and that this, in turn, promotes an increase in the rate of protein synthesis and the subsequent hypertrophic response. However, this model is based on a number of important assumptions that have not been rigorously tested. In this study, we created skeletal muscle specific and inducible raptor knockout mice to eliminate signaling by mTORC1, and with these mice we were able to directly demonstrate that mechanical stimuli can activate signaling by mTORC1, and that mTORC1 is necessary for mechanical load-induced hypertrophy. Surprisingly, however, we also obtained multiple lines of evidence that indicate that mTORC1 is not required for a mechanical load-induced increase in the rate of protein synthesis. This observation highlights an important shortcoming in our understanding of how mechanical loads induce hypertrophy and illustrates that additional mTORC1-independent mechanisms play a critical role in this process.—You, J.-S., McNally, R.

This study investigated the chronic effects of NS5806 on cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice in vivo and on neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) in vitro. Four weeks after TAC, NS5806 was administered by gavage for 4 weeks. Echocardiograms revealed pronounced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in TAC-treated mice compared with sham mice. NS5806 attenuated LV hypertrophy, as manifested by the restoration of LV wall thickness and weight and the reversal"

Magnetic resonance imaging measured elbow flexor muscles cross-sectional area (EFCSA) pre- and post-training at 45%, 65%, and 85% of humerus length.Results:EFCSA significantly increased in both SHORT (P= 0.04) and LONG (P= 0.05) at 45% and 85% lengths (P< 0.01 for both). Changes in EFCSA between SHORT and LONG were statistically similar at the 45% (+6.20% vs +5.08%; Cohend= 0.006;P= 0.98), 65% (+5.91% vs +3.83%, Cohend =0.28,P= 0.30), and 85% lengths (+8.51% vs +7.38%, Cohend =0.18,P= 0.56).Conclusion:Muscle hypertrophy of the elbow flexor muscles displayed a similar behavior after low-load elbow flexion training with vascular occlusion performed in the extended versus flexed shoulder position.Clinical Relevance:Therapists, clinicians, and coaches may choose elbow flexion exercises expecting to achieve similar results for hypertrophy in this muscle group, such that exercise selection may rely on availability of equipment in the training room or personal preference.Get full access to this articleView all access and purchase options for this article.Get AccessReferences1.Boninger ML, Cooper RA, Shimada SD, Rudy TE.

Spangenburg.Author AffiliationsAssistant Professor University of Maryland.to the editor:This is a timely Point:Counterpoint that addresses the role of IGF-I in the regulation of muscle mass. Clearly, IGF-I is critical for muscle development and postnatal muscle growth (2). However, its role in the area of load-induced muscle hypertrophy has been recently questioned (5). There are a few clarifications that should be made, in that the mice used in my study are not knockouts of the IGF-I receptor as implicated by Flüeck and Goldspink (6), but they are transgenic mice that contain a point mutation in the ATP binding domain resulting in abrogated IGF-I receptor function in a dominant negative fashion. Second, one of the key points of my findings was that it was possible for mechanical load to activate mTOR signaling independent of the IGF-I receptor. There are other critical pieces of evidence that must be considered as well. In response to acute loading, the increase in IGF-I production by the muscle occurs over a matter of days (1), while activation of the mTOR signaling is activated in a matter of minutes to hours (4). Furthermore, a major critical aspect of IGF-I signaling is Akt activation; however, the magnitude of phosphorylation and duration of activation of Akt in response to acute mechanical loading is substantially smaller compared to downstream components of mTOR (i.e. p70s6k) (4). Thus, unless IGF-I bypasses Akt to induce protein synthesis, it would suggest that mTOR is likely activated independent of Akt and IGF-I. Stewart and Pell (6) suggest that all muscle growth is dependent on satellite cell activation (6); however, mechanical load can induce smaller increases in muscle mass independent of satellite cell activation (3). Thus, if the major role of IGF-I is to affect satellite cell function and there are cases where we can get growth of muscle without satellite cell activation, then we must conclude IGF-I is not always necessary for muscle growth.REFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein accumulation during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Appl Physiol81: 2509–2516,1996.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar2.Liu JP , Baker J , Perkins AS , Robertson EJ , Efstratiadis A.Mice carrying null mutations of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor I (Igf-1) and type 1 IGF receptor (Igf1r).Cell75: 59–72,1993.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar3.Mitchell PO , Pavlath GK.A muscle precursor cell-dependent pathway contributes to muscle growth after atrophy.Am J Physiol Cell Physiol281: C1706–C1715,2001.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar4.O'Neil TK , Duffy LR , Frey JW , Hornberger TA.The role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphatidic acid in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin following eccentric contractions.J Physiol587: 3691–3701,2009.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar5.Spangenburg EE , Le Roith D , Ward CW , Bodine SC.A functional insulin-like growth factor receptor is not necessary for load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Physiol586: 283–291,2008.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar6.Stewart C , Pell JM , Flueck M , Goldspink G.Point:Counterpoint: IGF is/is not the major physiological regulator of muscle mass.J Appl Physiol. doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01246.2009.Web of Science|Google ScholarREFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein a"

A random-effects model was used to calculate mean effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Thirty-five studies were included (age range: 59.0–88.5 yr), and 44 and 30 effects were used to estimate RT impact on myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and II fiber size. RT produced moderate-to-large increases in MHC I (ES = +0.51, 95%CI +0.31 to +0.71;P< 0.001) and II (ES = +0.81, 95%CI +0.56 to +1.05;P< 0.001) fiber size, with men and women having a similar response. Age was negatively associated with change in muscle fiber size for both fiber types (MHC I:R2= 0.11, β = −0.33,P= 0.002; MHC II:R2= 0.10, β = −0.32,P= 0.04), indicating a less robust hypertrophic response as age increases in older adults. Unexpectedly, a higher training intensity (defined as percentage of one-repetition maximum) was associated with a smaller increase in MHC II fiber size (R2= 15.09%, β = −0.39,P= 0.01). Notably, MHC II fiber subtypes (IIA, IIX, IIAX) were examined less frequently, but RT improved their size. Overall, our findings indicate that RT induces cellular hypertrophy in older adults, although the effect is attenuated with increasing age. In addition, hypertrophy of MHC II fibers was reduced with higher training intensity, which may suggest a failure of muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to high loads in older adults.INTRODUCTIONSarcopenia, or the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age, leads to poor physical performance in older adults (28,53). Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to mitigate the effects of sarcopenia are, therefore, of great public health interest. The safest and most effective strategy for maintaining and/or increasing skeletal muscle mass is resistance training (RT), and this is broadly recognized across the scientific and clinical communities. For instance, the second edition of thePhysical Activity Guidelines for Americansreleased in 2018 recommends muscle-strengthening activities, in addition to aerobic and balance activities, for older adults (77). Other organizations, such as the American College of Sports Medicine, also recommend the inclusion of RT in any comprehensive exercise regimen for older adults (34).Skeletal muscle is a plastic tissue (31), and one of the most well-accepted chronic adaptations to RT exercise is an increase in muscle size, referred to as hypertrophy (2).

We examined whether cigarette smoke (CS) exposure and/or vitamin D deficiency impairs the skeletal muscle hypertrophic response to overload. Male C57Bl/6JolaH mice on a normal or vitamin D-deficient diet were exposed to CS or room air for 18 wk. Six weeks after initiation of smoke or air exposure, sham surgery or denervation of the agonists of the left plantaris muscle was performed. The right leg served as internal control. Twelve weeks later, the hypertrophic response was assessed. CS exposure instigated loss of body and muscle mass, and increased lung inflammatory cell infiltration (P< 0.05), independently of diet. Maximal exercise capacity, whole body strength, in situ plantaris muscle force, and key markers of hypertrophic signaling (Akt, 4EBP1, and FoxO1) were not si"

Here we show that RhoA in SCs is indispensable to have correct muscle regeneration and hypertrophy. In particular, the absence of RhoA in SCs prevents a correct SC fusion both to other RhoA-deleted SCs (regeneration context) and to growing control myofibers (hypertrophy context). We demonstrated that RhoA is dispensable for SCs proliferation and differentiation; however, RhoA-deleted SCs have an inefficient movement even if their cytoskeleton assembly is not altered. Proliferative myoblast and differentiated myotubes without RhoA display a decreased expression ofChordin, suggesting a crosstalk between these genes for myoblast fusion regulation. These findings demonstrate the importance of RhoA in SC fusion regulation and its requirement to achieve an efficient skeletal muscle homeostasis restoration.Keywords:adult muscle stem cells, muscle regeneration, small GTPase proteins, muscle damage, muscle hypertrophy, muscle cell fusion1. IntroductionSkeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue, able to adapt to different events such as exercise or injury throughout life, which leads to a continuous recurrence of regeneration to maintain proper tissue homeostasis. Muscle regeneration is a fine-regulated process in which the main actors are the satellite cells (SCs), the adult muscle stem cells. They are located under the basal lamina in a quiescent state and, in response to injury, they exit this dormant state getting activated. This trans"

All rights reservedPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC4252615 NIHMSID: NIHMS626845 PMID:25218762The publisher's version of this article is available atLife SciAbstractPathologic and physiologic factors acting on the heart can produce consistent pressure changes, volume overload, or increased cardiac output. These changes may then lead to cardiac remodeling, ultimately resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. Exercise can also induce hypertrophy, primarily physiologic in nature. To determine the mechanisms responsible for each type of remodeling, it is important to examine the heart at the functional unit, the cardiomyocyte. Tests of individual cardiomyocyte functionin vitroprovide deeper understanding of the changes occurring within the heart during hypertrophy. Examination of cardiomyocyte function during exercise primarily follows one of two pathways: the addition of hypertrophic inducing agentsin vitroto normal cardiomyocytes, or the use of trained animal models and isolating cells following the development of hypertrophyin vivo. Due to the short lifespan of adult cardiomyocytes, a proportionately scant amount of research exists involving the direct stimulation of cellsin vitroto induce hypertrophy. These attempts provide the only current evidence, as it is difficult to gather extensive data demonstrating cell growth as a result ofin vitrophysical stimulation. Researchers have created ways to combine skeletal myocytes with cardiomyocytes to produce functional muscle cells used to repair pathologic heart tissue, but continue to struggle with the short lifespan of these cells. While there have been promising findings regarding the mechanisms that surround cardiac hypertrophyin vitro, the translation ofin vitrofindings toin vivofunction is not consistent. Therefore, the focus of this review is to highlight recent studies that have investigated the effect of exercise on the heart, bothin vitroandin vivo.Keywords:myocyte, heart, exercise, hypertrophy, signaling mechanismsINTRODUCTIONCardiac hypertrophy is defined as an increase in heart mass in response to an increased load on the myocardium attributable to physiologic or pathologic stimulation (Cooper, 1987). Pathological conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction, can increase the width or length of individual cardiomyocytes, leading to gross changes in ventricular structure. Interestingly, certain hypertrophic changes observed in diseased states are mimicked by exercise training, however, these are physiologic in nature (D'Andrea et al., 2007). Hypertrophy, regardless of mechanism, may lead to hypertension, infarction, or arrhythmia, ultimately predisposing individuals to heart failure (Gaasch and Zile, 2004). This fact underlies the importance of understanding and differentiating the mechanisms of physiologic- and pathologic-induced hypertrophy (D'Andrea, Caso, 2007,Gielen et al., 2010).Figure 1provides a visual representation of the gross similarities and differences in these mechanisms.Open in a new tabCardiomyocyte growth occurs in either eccentric or concentric forms, depending on the type of stimulus (Fernandes et al., 2011). Volume overload causes cardiomyocytes to grow eccentrically through serial sarcomere addition, increasing myocardial"

LVH is driven by neurohumoral activation, increased mechanical load, and cytokines associated with arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and other comorbidities. Here we discuss the experimental and clinical evidence that links LVH to diastolic dysfunction and qualifies LVH as one diagnostic marker for HFpEF. Mechanisms leading to diastolic dysfunction in LVH are incompletely understood, but may include extracellular matrix changes, vascular dysfunction, as well as altered cardiomyocyte mechano-elastical properties. Beating cardiomyocytes from HFpEF patients have not yet been studied, but we and others have shown increased Ca2+turnover and impaired relaxation in cardiomyocytes from hypertrophied hearts. Structural myocardial remodeling can lead to heterogeneity in regional myocardial contractile function, which contributes to diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF. In the clinical setting of patients with compound comorbidities, diastolic dysfunction may occur independently of LVH. This may be one explanation why current approaches to reduce LVH have not been effective to improve symptoms and prognosis in HFpEF. Exercise training, on the other hand, in clinical trials improved exercise tolerance and diastolic function, but did not reduce LVH. Thus current clinical evidence does not support regression of LVH as a surrogate marker for (short-term) improvement of HFpEF.LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY: CLINICAL PRESENTATIONHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or diastolic heart failure (DHF; as it has been classically referenced) is common, of increasing prevalence, and causes a substantial reduction in prognosis. In the majority of patients with symptomatic HFpEF, a history of hypertensive heart disease, including changes in left ventricular (LV) geometry, such as myocardial hypertrophy, can be found. Myocardial hypertrophy is defined as an increase in ventricular myocardial mass. In clinical practice and in animal studies, LV hypertrophy (LVH) is often assessed by measurement of end-diastolic thickness of septal and LV p"

The Journal of Physiology © 2017 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC5685821 PMID:28949007Blood flow restriction (BFR) training is characterised by the application of a pneumatic cuff to the working limb during resistance or aerobic exercise. When performed at low loads (20–50% one repetition maximum (1‐RM)), BFR training can greatly improve skeletal muscle strength and size (Takaradaet al.2000). Therefore, improvements in skeletal muscle mass and function may be achieved with low‐load BFR training in patients who are contraindicated from performing traditional heavy‐load resistance exercise. Although the mechanisms mediating these adaptations are somewhat unclear, the localised hypoxia and metabolic stress during BFR exercise are thought to stimulate various cellular events. These cellular events include inflammation and oxidative stress, and are potentially mediated by stress‐induced proteins such as heat shock chaperone proteins. However, these responses are poorly characterised and their effect on muscle damage and hypertrophy are unclear in BFR training.Regeneration and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle after damaging exercise requires a co‐ordinated cellular response, including the infiltration of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory macrophages. A potential mediator of this regenerative process in BFR exercise is the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). During stress, HSPs function as molecular chaperones in the cell and may play a role in protein synthesis, folding, transport and turnover. An acute bout of BFR exercise can upregulate HSP expression within myofibres and induce translocation of HSPs to cytoskeletal structures (Cumminget al.2014). This is perhaps related to metabolic stress and structural myofibre damage.The effect of low‐load BFR training on skeletal muscle damage is somewhat unclear due to inconsistencies in current literature. This poses the question; is BFR training achievable in low‐physical‐functioning clinical populations? Nielsen and colleagues therefore aimed to investigate the effect of a longitudinal BFR training programme on markers of muscle damage, cellular stress and inflammation, including pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory macrophage activation and infiltration. This investigation is described in a recent article published inThe Journal of Physiology(Nielsenet al.2017).Nielsenet al. (2017) performed two randomised controlled trials to achieve their aim. In a 3‐week study, the myocellular damage and inflammatory response to low‐load resistance BFR exercise was compared to non‐BFR control exercise performed at the same intensity. A separate 1‐week study compared the acute responses between low‐load BFR training and traditional non‐BFR heavy‐load resistance exercise. The authors hypothesised that 3 weeks of low‐load BFR training would increase myocellular damage and inflammation early in the training programme, while non‐BFR low‐load resistance training would not. Additionally, low‐load BFR training and traditional heavy‐load resistance training were expected to induce similar muscle damage and inflammation.In the 3‐week study, 20 recreationally active 18‐ to 35‐year‐old men performed 23 sessions of unilateral knee extensor exercise at 20% 1‐RM. Twelve participants were randomised to BFR training (BFRE), whilst eight participants were randomised to work‐matched training without BFR (LLE). A pressure‐adjustable pneumatic cuff (13.5 cm width) was applied proximally to the upper leg, and inflated throughout BFRE training sessions at 100 mmHg. Dynamic contractions (knee extension) were performed to failure. Four muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were obtained; baseline, before session eight, and 3 and 10 days after training ceased. Immunofluorescent staining of CD68 and CD206 was conducted to quantify macrophages, and the ratio of CD68 to CD206 was used to distinguish between M1 and M2 macrophage populations. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting was used to quantify and localise HSP27 and HSP70.In the 1‐week st"

Muscle mass is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation which is controlled by a number of intracellular signaling pathways, most notably the insulin/IGF/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system. Despite being activated by IGF-1 and having well-described functions in the determination of muscle fiber phenotypes, calcineurin (CnA), a Ca2+-activated serine/threonine phosphatase, and its downstream signaling partners have garnered little attention as a regulator of muscle mass. Compared to other signaling pathways, the relatively few studies that have examined the role of CnA in the regulation of muscle size have produced discordant results. The reasons for these differences is not obvious but may be due to the selective nature of the genetic models studied, fluctuations in the endogenous level of CnA activity in various muscles, and the variable use of CnA inhibitors to inhibit CnA signaling. Despite the inconsistent nature of the outcomes, there is sufficient direct and indirect evidence to conclude that CnA plays a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass.Keywords:calcineurin, skeletal muscle, atrophy, hypertrophy, cell signalingINTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle hypertrophy is an adaptive process that results largely from stimulation of mTOR and protein synthesis pathways by exercise, growth factors and other anabolic hormones, and neuronal input. In contrast, muscle atrophy is a debilitating consequence of a range of pathologic and metabolic conditions including disuse/inactivity, cancer, renal failure, diabetes, AIDS, and sepsis. It is widely accepted that skeletal muscle atrophy is a combinatorial process that involves both a decrease in muscle protein synthesis and an increase in protein degradation (Eley and Tisdale, 2007,Jackman and Kandarian, 2004,Powers et al., 2007). Given the physiological complexity of maintaining muscle mass, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis and degradation during growth and atrophy.Over the past decade, a number of studies have examined the role of calcineurin (CnA) in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. CnA, also known as protein phosphatase-3, is a serine/threonine phosphatase that is activated by sustained increased levels of intracellular Ca2+(Crabtree, 1999). CnA is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic A subunit and smaller calcium-binding regulatory B subunit (Crabtree, 1999,Rusnak and Mertz, 2000). Three 59–62 kDa isoforms of the catalytic CnA subunit have been identified that arise from separate genes: CnAα, CnAβ, and CnAγ (Klee et al., 1998,Rusnak and Mertz, 2000). CnAα and CnAβ are abundant in a wide variety of tissues including skeletal muscle. In contrast, CnAγ is predominately located in the testis and brain as a result of differential gene expression (Klee, Ren, 1998,Rusnak and Mertz, 2000). The presence of microRNAs that specifically target CnAγ may also contribute to its tissue expression pattern (Chhabra et al., 2011).Although the downstream effectors of CnA have not been fully elucidated, CnA signaling is known to be important for proper function of both cardiac and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, CnA participates in a variety of processes including myoblast recruitment, myotube differentiation, fiber type specification, and recovery from muscle injury and dystrophic muscle damage (Friday et al., 2000,Horsley et al., 2001,Horsley et al., 2003,Naya et al., 2000,Parsons et al., 2003,Stupka et al., 2006).

Although overload-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy is normally associated with satellite cell-mediated myonuclear accretion, hypertrophic adaptation proceeds in the absence of satellite cells in fully grown adult mice, but not in young growing mice. Emerging evidence also indicates that satellite cells play an important role in remodeling the extracellular matrix during hypertrophy.IntroductionIn 1865, structures that were termed “muskelkörperchen,” or “muscle corpuscles,” were first identified during the study of muscle regeneration (193). Although the precise origin of these cells was unknown, they were thought to give rise to new muscle fibers (164). Almost 100 years later, Alexander Mauro (106) and Nobel laureate Sir Bernard Katz (82) independently but simultaneously observed these same cells while studying the peripheral regions of extrafusal and intrafusal fibers, respectively. They referred to these cells as “satellite cells,” given their satellite-like position along the outside boundary of the sarcolemma. Although Mauro is almost exclusively credited with coining the term “satellite cell,” J. David Robertson used the term “satellite cell” in investigations of intrafusal muscle fibers that predated both Mauro and Katz; however, Robertson believed that peripherally located satellite cells were related to Schwann cells (154). Nevertheless, in the opening paragraph of his seminal report, Mauro speculated that satellite cells could be the engines of muscle regeneration. Shortly thereafter, numerous investigations linked satellite cells to the progression of the regenerative process after injury (4,5,31,169). Although satellite cells were identified, their origi"

Based onin vivoandex vivomicroscopy we here propose a cellular memory mechanism residing in the muscle cells. Female mice were treated with testosterone propionate for 14 days, inducing a 66% increase in the number of myonuclei and a 77% increase in fibre cross-sectional area. Three weeks after removing the drug, fibre size was decreased to the same level as in sham treated animals, but the number of nuclei remained elevated for at least 3 months (>10% of the mouse lifespan). At this time, when the myonuclei-rich muscles were exposed to overload-exercise for 6 days, the fibre cross-sectional area increased by 31% while control muscles did not grow significantly. We suggest that the lasting, elevated number of myonuclei constitutes a cellular memory facilitating subsequent muscle overload hypertrophy. Our findings might have consequences for the exclusion time of doping offenders. Since the ability to generate new myonuclei is impaired in the elderly our data also invites speculation that it might be beneficial to perform strength training when young in order to benefit in senescence.Key pointsTraining studio folklore suggests that previous strength training, with or without the use of anabolic steroids facilitates re-acquisition of muscle mass even after long intervening periods of inactivity. This ‘muscle memory’ has previously been attributed to motor learning, but our data suggest the existence of a cellular memory residing in the muscle fibres themselves.Muscle fibres have multiple nuclei, and the number of nuclei increases when muscle mass increases.When mice were briefly treated with steroids the muscle mass and number of nuclei increased. The drug was subsequently withdrawn for 3 months and the muscle mass returned to normal, but the excess cell nuclei persisted. When such muscles were subjected to overload they grew by 30% over 6 days while controls grew insignificantly.Our data suggest that previous strength training might be beneficial later in life, and that a brief exposure to anabolic steroids might have long lasting performance-enhancing effects.IntroductionTogether with neurons, muscle fibres constitute one of the two major post-mitotic tissues of the body. They are by volume the largest cells in mammals (Bruusgaardet al.2003), and represent one of very few syncytia in vertebrates. The permanent fibres can contain hundreds of nuclei (Bruusgaardet al.2003), each surrounded by its own synthetic machinery synthesizing protein for a local domain in its immediate vicinity (Hall & Ralston, 1989;Pavlathet al.1989). During overload hypertrophy the increase in fibre volume is preceded by the incorporation of new myonuclei from interstitial muscle stem cells (satellite cells;Schiaffinoet al.1976;Bruusgaardet al.2010;Wang & Rudnicki, 2012). Recent evidence suggest that these ‘extra’ nuclei are permanent or at least long lasting even under subsequent conditions where muscle mass is lost (Wadaet al.2002;Aravamudanet al.2006;Bruusgaard & Gundersen, 2008;Gundersen & Bruusgaard, 2008;Bruusgaardet al.2010,2012;van der Meeret al.2011). Thus, while muscle hypertrophy is completely reversible when it comes to muscle mass, a previous hypertrophic condition seems to convey a lasting imprint on muscle fibres in the form of an elevated number of myonuclei.We he"

The Journal of Physiology © 2016 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC5157116 PMID:27976396The benefits of resistance training for skeletal muscle mass and strength are well characterised. Early adaptations to unaccustomed resistance exercise include increased muscle strength, whereas later adaptations include muscle hypertrophy and further improvements in muscle strength (Schoenfeld,2010). Although these strength and hypertrophy gains following resistance training are well documented in healthy and clinical populations, the mechanisms surrounding these phenomena are less implicit. The skeletal muscle microenvironment is tightly regulated and responds rapidly to resistance exercise. A single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise can cause damage to skeletal muscle, where the structural integrity of the myofibres is compromised. This was theorised to be a significant event which stimulates hypertrophic responses within the muscle microenvironment (Schoenfeld,2010). However, progression through a resistance training programme is marked by an attenuation in muscle damage which is termed the ‘repeated bout effect’. These findings have lead researchers to question the role of muscle damage in muscle hypertrophy following resistance training. One key factor which has an important yet poorly understood association with muscle damage and hypertrophy following resistance exercise is muscle protein synthesis.Previous work by Damas and colleagues has demonstrated that resistance exercise is a potent stimulator of skeletal muscle protein synthesis (Damaset al.2015). In the hours following an unaccustomed bout of resistance exercise, an increase in myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis (MyoPS) can be detected. Repeated bouts of resistance exercise cause cumulative periods of increased MyoPS where net protein synthesis is greater than protein degradation, thus favouring muscle hypertrophy (Damaset al.2015). However, the MyoPS response to resistance exercise is not equivocal as the resistance training programme progresses. Attenuation of the MyoPS response to resistance exercise can be observed as early as 3 weeks into a training programme (Brooket al.2015). Interestingly, the MyoPS response to initial resistance exercise bouts is not correlated with muscle hypertrophy that occurs later in the training programme (Damaset al.2015). However, the MyoPS response to later bouts of the resistance training programme correlates strongly with muscle hypertrophy (Brooket al.2015). The authors noted that initial bouts of unaccustomed resistance exercise cause pronounced muscle damage, which stimulates growth mechanisms and increases protein synthesis to support tissue repair. Damas therefore proposed that the lack of correlation between the MyoPS response to initial exercise bouts and subsequent muscle hypertrophy could be due to exercise‐induced muscle damage, and that the early MyoPS response is focused on repairing damaged muscle. However, following resistance training the MyoPS response is a more dedicated driver of muscle hypertrophy. Continuing on from previous research, Damaset al. therefore investigated the modulation of muscle hypertrophy during resistance training by measuring MyoPS and muscle damage throughout a resistance training intervention. The study is described in a recent article published inThe Journal of Physiology(Damaset al.2016). The authors hypothesised that the MyoPS response to the initial bout of resistance exercise would not be related to muscle hypertrophy at the end of the training programme, but that MyoPS responses at weeks 3 and 10 would be related to hypertrophy. This hypothesis would imply that the acute MyoPS response to initial bouts of resistance training cannot be used to predict subsequent muscle hypertrophy.Using a robust study design, Damaset al. (2016a) conducted a 10 week resistance training intervention in healthy young men to assess skeletal muscle damage, MyoPS and hypertrophic responses. Ten participants were recruited to perform high intensity lower body resistance trainin"

However, the importance of ROS and RNS as signals in the cellular adaptation process to stress is now evident. In an effort to combat the perceived deleterious effects of ROS and RNS it has become common practice for active individuals to ingest supplements with antioxidant properties, but interfering with ROS/RNS signalling in skeletal muscle during acute exercise may blunt favourable adaptation. There is building evidence that antioxidant supplementation can attenuate endurance training‐induced and ROS/RNS‐mediated enhancements in antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular defence mechanisms and insulin sensitivity. However, this is not a universal finding, potentially indicating that there is redundancy in the mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise, meaning that in some circumstances the negative impact of antioxidants on acute exercise response can be overcome by training. Antioxidant supplementation has been more consistently reported to have deleterious effects on the response to overload stress and high‐intensity training, suggesting that remodelling of skeletal muscle following resistance and high‐intensity exercise is more dependent on ROS/RNS signalling. Importantly there is no convincing evidence to suggest that antioxidant supplementation enhances exercise‐training adaptions. Overall, ROS/RNS are likely to exhibit a non‐linear (hormetic) pattern on exercise adaptations, where physiological doses are beneficial and high exposure (which would seldom be achieved during normal exercise training) may be detrimental.AbbreviationsAMPK5′‐adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinaseCaMKCa2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinaseCKcreatine kinaseGpxglutathione peroxidasesIL‐6interleukin 6HSPheat shock proteinl‐NAMENG‐nitro‐l‐arginineMAPKmitogen‐activated protein kinasesMHCmyosin heavy chainmTORmechanistic target of rapamycinmtTFAmitochondrial transcription factor ANADPHnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphateNFATnuclear factor of activated T‐cellsNFE2l2nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2NF‐κBnuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cellsNOnitric oxideNOSnitric oxide synthaseNRF1nuclear respiratory factorsPGC1αperoxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ coactivator 1αRNSreactive nitrogen speciesROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseV˙O2maxmaximal oxygen uptakeReactive oxygen species and exercise trainingRegular exercise improves the function of multiple organs in the human body, and reduces the risk of developing diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia, and by that increases life expectancy (Warburtonet al.2006). One of the most plastic and responsive organs to exercise training is skeletal muscle (Bassel‐Duby & Olson,2006). Physiological stress applied through repeated bouts of acute exercise (training) induces skeletal muscle adaptations that improve the muscles ability to deal with future exercise stress, and the potential to cope with other similar stressors which may be associated with disease development. Adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle in response to exercise training are dependent on the parameters of the exercise stress applied, with resistance training promoting hypertrophy and endurance training having greater effects on muscle oxidative capacity (Bassel‐Duby & Olson,2006). One of the many stressors that are imposed through exercise is an increased exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Powers & Jackson,2008).During exercise skeletal muscle ROS are produced from both mitochondrial and non‐mitochondrial sources, which include xanthine oxidases, NADPH oxidases and phospholipase A2, while the parent"

While increased expression of MMPs (especially MMP-9) has been observed in skeletal muscle in numerous conditions, their physiological significance remains less-well understood. By generating novel skeletal muscle-specific transgenic (Tg) mice expressing constitutively active mutant of MMP-9 (i.e. MMP-9G100L), in this study, we have investigated the effects of elevated levels of MMP-9 on skeletal muscle structure and functionin vivo. Tg expression of enzymatically active MMP-9 protein significantly increased skeletal muscle fiber cross-section area, levels of contractile proteins and force production in isometric contractions. MMP-9 stimulated the activation of the Akt signaling pathway in Tg mice. Moreover, expression of active MMP-9 increased the proportion of fast-type fiber in soleus muscle of mice. Overexpression of MMP-9 also considerably reduced the deposition of collagens I and IV in skeletal musclein vivo. In one-year-oldmdxmice (a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD), deletion of theMmp9gene reduced fiber hypertrophy and phosphorylation of Akt and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Collectively, our study suggests that elevated levels of active MMP-9 protein cause hypertrophy in skeletal muscle and that the modulation of MMP-9 levels may have therapeutic value in various muscular disorders including DMD.INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle has enormous plasticity to adapt to a wide variety of environmental stimuli. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of skeletal muscle is critical to maintaining its structural integrity, plasticity and normal function (1,2). The role of ECM in skeletal muscle plasticity is evident by the findings that the majority of genes up-regulated in response to exercise training are related to ECM (3). Furthermore, excessive degradation of ECM is a major pathological feature in skeletal muscle degenerative disorders such as muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathies (4–7).Extracellular proteases play a pivotal role in altering local microenvironment during embryonic development and growth and tissue remodeling processes. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a relatively large family of Zn2+containing, Ca2+-requiring endopeptidases causing proteolysis of selective ECM components (7,8). MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) are the main MMPs that degrade type IV collagen, the most prevalent protein in skeletal muscle basal lamina (9). Despite their similarity in substrate specificity, the general patterns of expression and transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are quite different and they appear to regulate different biolo"

However, the combined effect of overloading and disuse on the quantitative adaptation of skeletal muscle is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined stimuli of overloading and disuse on mouse skeletal muscle mass and the expression of regulatory factors for muscle protein anabolism or catabolism. Male mice from the Institute Cancer Research were subjected to denervation concomitant with unilateral functional overload or functional overload concomitant with unilateral denervation. Disuse and functional overload were induced by sciatic nerve transection (denervation) and synergist ablation, respectively, and the plantaris muscle was harvested 14 days after the operation. Our results showed that denervation attenuated functional overload‐induced muscle hypertrophy and functional overload partially ameliorated the denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. P70S6K phosphorylation, an indicator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, was not increased by unilateral functional overload in denervated muscles or by unilateral denervation in functional overloaded muscles. Denervation did not affect the increase of LC3‐II, a marker of autophagy activation, and ubiquitinated protein expression upon unilateral functional overload. Also, functional overload did not affect ubiquitinated protein expression during unilateral denervation. Thus, our findings suggest that functional overload‐induced muscle hypertrophy or denervation‐induced muscle atrophy was attenuated by the combined stimuli of overload and denervation.Keywords:denervation, functional overload, skeletal muscleThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined stimuli of overloading and disuse on mouse skeletal muscle mass and the expression of regulatory factors for muscle protein anabolism or catabolism. The mice were subjected to denervation concomitant with unilateral functional overload or functional overload concomitant with unilateral denervation.1. INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle is known to have a high degree of quantitative plasticity, such as hypertrophy in response to mechanical loading (e.g., functional overload, resistance exercise—Boone et al.,2015; McCarthy et al.,2011), and atrophy in response to unloading (e.g., space flight, inactivity—Hayashi et al.,2021; Zhang et al.,2018). Skeletal muscle mass is largely dependent on protein metabolism, which is the balance between the synthesis and degradation of muscle proteins (Tipton & Wolfe,2001).Surgical synergist ablation‐induced functional overload is an experimental model that has classically been used to investigate the response of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and its molecular mechanisms in rodents (Bodine et al.,2001). This surgical operation induces a compensatory hypertrophy in the plantaris muscle by ablation of the synergist muscles, gastrocnemius and soleus (Fujimaki et al.,2016; Shirai et al.,2022; Uemichi et al.,2021). Previous studies have reported that functional overload activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, a key regulatory mechanism for muscle protein synthesis, and induced hypertrophy (Goodman et al.,2011; Miyazaki et al.,2011).

Skeletal muscle mass is determined by the balance of protein synthesis and degradation within muscle cells. We sought to determine which cellular proteins that control protein synthesis within muscle cells are associated with muscle growth after resistance exercise, a potent growth stimulus. We identified two proteins that were associated with muscle growth in humans: p70S6K and eIF2Bɛ. Follow up studies determined that eIF2Bɛ alone is sufficient to induce muscle growth. This is the first study to determine that this protein can induce skeletal muscle growth. These results further our understanding of how skeletal muscle responds to resistance exercise.AbstractAbstractThe purpose of this study was to identify signalling components known to control mRNA translation initiation in skeletal muscle that are responsive to mechanical load and may be partly responsible for myofibre hypertrophy. To accomplish this, we first utilized a human cluster model in which skeletal muscle samples from subjects with widely divergent hypertrophic responses to resistance training were used for the identification of signalling proteins associated with the degree myofibre hypertrophy. We found that of 11 translational signalling molecules examined, the response of p(T421/S424)-p70S6K phosphorylation and total eukaryotic initiation factor 2Bɛ (eIF2Bɛ) protein abundance after a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise was associated with myofibre hypertrophy following 16 weeks of training. Follow up studies revealed that overexpression of eIF2Bɛ alone was sufficient to induce an 87% increase in cap-dependent translation in L6 myoblastsin vitroand 21% hypertrophy of myofibres in mouse skeletal musclein vivo(P< 0.05). However, genetically altering p70S6K activity had no impact on eIF2Bɛ protein abundance in mouse skeletal musclein vivoor multiple cell linesin vitro(P> 0.05), suggesting that the two phenomena were not directly related. These are the first data that mechanistically link eIF2Bɛ abundance to skeletal myofibre hypertrophy, and indicate that eIF2Bɛ abundance may at least partially underlie the widely divergent hypertrophic phenotypes in human skeletal muscle exposed to mechanical stimuli.IntroductionTranslation initiation pathways, including PI3K/ Akt/mTOR and eIF2B, are key determinates of cell size regulation in a number of model systems including skeletal muscle (Bodineet al.2001;Rommelet al.2001;Hardtet al.2004;Laiet al.2004). Furthermore, mechanical load, a stimulus that induces skeletal muscle cell (i.e. myofibre) hypertrophy, increases the activity of translation initiation pathways in both animal (Baar & Esser, 1999;Parkingtonet al.2003) and human (Blomstrandet al.2006;Coffeyet al.2006;Dreyeret al.2006;Mayhewet al.2009) muscle leading to increased functional and metabolic reserves of the tissue.

This study investigated the effect of 8 wk of resistance training on myofiber hypertrophy and myonuclear addition in 12 males (28 ± 7 yr; mean ± SD) and 12 females (27 ± 7 yr). Muscle biopsies were collected from m. vastus lateralis before and after the training intervention and were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for fiber type and size, satellite cells, and myonuclei. Hypertrophy of type I fibers was greater in males than females (P< 0.05), whereas hypertrophy of type II fibers was similar between sexes (P= 0.158–0.419). Expansion of the satellite cell pool (P= 0.132–0.667) and myonuclear addition (P= 0.064–0.228) did not differ significantly between sexes, irrespective of myofiber type. However, when individual responses to resistance training were assessed, myonuclear addition was strongly correlated with fiber hypertrophy (r= 0.68–0.85,P< 0.001). Although myofiber hypertrophy was accompanied by an increase in myonuclear domain (P< 0.05), fiber perimeter per myonucleus remained constant throughout the study (P= 0.096–0.666). These findings indicate that myonuclear addition occurs in relation to the fiber perimeter per myonucleus, not the myonuclear domain, and has a substantial role in resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy but does not fully explain greater hypertrophy of type I fibers in males than females.NEW & NOTEWORTHYHere, we show that resistance training-induced hypertrophy of type I fibers is greater in males than females. Myonuclear addition was strongly associated with fiber hypertrophy but did not differ between sexes in type I fibers. Furthermore, whereas muscle hypertrophy was accompanied by an increase in myonuclear domain, fiber perimeter per myonucleus remained constant. Thus, myonuclear addition occurs in relation to fiber perimeter during muscle hypertrophy but does not explain sex-specific hypertrophy of type I fibers.INTRODUCTIONIn 2006, Petrella et al.

Conclusion was also modified.AbstractMasseter muscle hypertrophy is a rare condition with no known etiology that has become more prevalent due to growing aesthetic concerns. It is distinguished by either unilaterally or bilaterally enlarged masseter muscles. Its origin is still unknown. This study discusses a clinically confirmed case of unilateral masseter muscle hypertrophy and provides an outline of the condition's etiology, prevalence, diagnosis, and course of treatment.Keywords:computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, masseter muscle hypertrophyIntroductionAnatomically, the masseter muscle is a robust, two-layered quadrate muscle. It originates from the inferior and deep surface of the zygomatic arch and mostly enters into the inferior lateral side of the mandibular ramus.1Unilateral or bilateral masseter muscle expansion is known as masseter hypertrophy. It may be asymptomatic or frequently accompanied by discomfort, which can occasionally be mistaken for parotid gland swelling.2–4For the functional, aesthetic, and differential diagnosis of head and neck pathology, it is an uncommon condition with an unknown cause. Since the etiological component is unknown in the majority of instances, the condition is classified as idiopathic. Although several causes, including bruxism, malocclusion, clenching, and temporomandibular joint abnormalities, have been mentioned, they have not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the etiological component is unknown in the majority of instances, the condition is classified as idiopathic. Despite being mentioned, a number of issues, including malocclusion, bruxism, clenching, and temporomandibular joint problems, have not been confirmed.5However, the most common reason patients with masseteric hypertrophy seek treatment is because of their facial appearance.5,6The masseter muscle plays a crucial function in face aesthetics since it is lateral to the mandibular ramus and necessary for proper mastication. For many people, a hypertrophied masseter will cause discomfort and adverse cosmetic effects by changing their face lines. Deficits in muscle function can also lead to the development of disorders such bruxism, protrusion, and trismus.5Healthcare providers must comprehend the subtleties of masseter hypertrophy since patients’ quality of life can be greatly enhanced by early detection and effective treatment. The case report's objectives are to outline the signs and symptoms of idiopathic masseter hypertrophy, offer a differential diagnosis, and recommend a course of action. The purpose of this case report is to add to the expanding body of knowledge on masseter hypertrophy by shedding light on its clinical characteristics, difficulties with diagnosis, and management techniques.Case reportA 19-year-old male visited the dental hospital's oral medicine department. Due to unilateral facial swelling, the patient complained of an unattractive appearance (Figure 1). The patient explained that the enlargement, which had been asymptomatic until now, had gradually in"

This view has been challenged by recent research revealing that ribosome composition could be heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity leads to functional ribosome specialization. This review presents the idea that ribosome heterogeneity results from changes in its various components, including variations in ribosomal protein (RP) composition, posttranslational modifications of RPs, changes in ribosomal-associated proteins, alternative forms of rRNA, and posttranscriptional modifications of rRNAs. Ribosome heterogeneity could be orchestrated at several levels and may depend on numerous factors, such as the subcellular location, cell type, tissue specificity, the development state, cell state, ribosome biogenesis, RP turnover, physiological stimuli, and circadian rhythm. Ribosome specialization represents a completely new concept for the regulation of gene expression. Specialized ribosomes could modulate several aspects of translational control, such as mRNA translation selectivity, translation initiation, translational fidelity, and translation elongation. Recent research indicates that the expression ofRpl3is markedly increased, while that ofRpl3lis highly reduced during mouse skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Moreover,Rpl3loverexpression impairs the growth and myogenic fusion of myotubes. Although the function ofRpl3andRpl3lin the ribosome remains to be clarified, these findings suggest that ribosome specialization may be potentially involved in the control of protein translation and skeletal muscle size. Limited data concerning ribosome specialization are currently available in skeletal muscle. Future investigations have the potential to delineate the function of specialized ribosomes in skeletal muscle.INTRODUCTIONRibosomes are highly conserved supramolecular ribonucleoprotein complexes that are responsible for translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein in all living organisms. These particles, mainly located in the cytoplasm or associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, were discovered by George Palade in the mid-1950s (44) and consist of two subunits. In eukaryotic cells, the small 40S subunit contains 33 ribosomal proteins (RP) and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and processes the decoding of mRNA by aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA). The large 60S subunit, which is composed of 47 RPs and 3 rRNAs (5S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs), plays a major role in the catalysis of peptide bond formation through the peptidyl-transferase reaction. Furthermore, a small proportion of ribosomes (which will not be discussed in this review) are located in mitochondria. These mitoribosomes, in contrast to the cytoplasmic ribosomes, are composed of a 39S large subunit and a 28S small subunit, with in total ~80 proteins and 2 rRNAs (47).Since the 1950s, the concepts regarding the activity and function of the ribosomes have considerably evolved, mainly because our understanding of cellular biology has been enhanced with the development of new techniques.

However, SA causes a decrease in specific force (i.e., force per cross-sectional area), likely due to excessive muscle use. Here, we investigated the mechanisms behind the SA-induced intrinsic contractile dysfunction, especially focusing on the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. Male Wistar rats had unilateral surgical ablation of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to induce compensatory hypertrophy in the plantaris muscles. Two weeks after SA, plantaris muscle was dissected from each animal and used for later analyses. SA significantly increased the mean fiber cross-sectional area (+18%). On the other hand, the ratio of depolarization-induced force to the maximum Ca2+-activated specific force, an indicator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+release, was markedly reduced in mechanically skinned fibers from the SA group (−51%). These functional defects were accompanied by an extensive fragmentation of the SR Ca2+release channel, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), and a decrease in the amount of other triad proteins (i.e., DHPR, STAC3, and junctophilin1). SA treatment also caused activation of calpain-1 and increased the amount of NADPH oxidase 2, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (i.e., Grp78, Grp94, PDI, and Ero1), and lipid peroxidation [i.e., 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)] in SA-treated muscles. Our findings show that SA causes skeletal muscle weakness due to impaired EC coupling. This is likely to be induced by Ca2+-dependent degradation of triad proteins, which may result from Ca2+leak from fragmented RyR1 triggered by increased oxidative stress.NEW & NOTEWORTHYSynergist ablation (SA) has widely been used to understand the mechanisms behind skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, compensatory hypertrophied muscles display intrinsic contractile dysfunction, i.e., a hallmark of overuse. Here, we demonstrate that SA-induced compensatory hypertrophy is accompanied by muscle weakness due to impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+release. This dysfunction may be caused by the degradation of triad proteins due to the reciprocal amplification of reactive oxygen species"

The purpose of the present study is to examine changes in type I/II myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) and muscle CSA (mCSA) of the vastus lateralis (VL) from before (Pre) to after (Post) 6 wk of high-load resistance training (HL;n= 15, 8 females) and low-load resistance training with BFR (n= 16, 8 females). Mixed-effects models were used to analyze fCSA with group (HL, BFR), sex (M, F), fiber type (I, II), and time (Pre, Post) included as factors. mCSA increased from pre- to posttraining (P< 0.001,d= 0.91) and was greater in males compared with females (P< 0.001,d= 2.26). Type II fCSA increased pre- to post-HL (P< 0.05,d= 0.46) and was greater in males compared with females (P< 0.05,d= 0.78). There were no significant increases in fCSA pre- to post-BFR for either fiber type or sex. Cohen’sd, however, revealed moderate effect sizes in type I and II fCSA for males (d= 0.59 and 0.67), although this did not hold true for females (d= 0.29 and 0.34). Conversely, the increase in type II fCSA was greater for females than for males after HL. In conclusion, low-load resistance training with BFR may not promote myofiber hypertrophy to the level of HL resistance training, and similar responses were generally observed for males and females. In contrast, comparable effect sizes for mCSA and 1-repetition maximum (1RM) between groups suggest that BFR could play a role in a resistance training program.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis is the first study, to our knowled"

Pulmonary O2uptake (V̇o2) and vastus lateralis muscle fractional O2extraction (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during an incremental cycle ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee-extension (KE) exercise. Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized vastus lateralis fibers obtained by biopsy. Quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area, volume (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), and strength were greater in RTA vs. CTRL (by ∼40%, ∼33%, and ∼20%, respectively). V̇o2peakduring CE was higher in RTA vs. CTRL (4.05 ± 0.64 vs. 3.56 ± 0.30 l/min); no difference between groups was observed during KE. The O2cost of CE exercise was not different between groups. When divided per muscle mass (for CE) or quadriceps muscle mass (for KE), V̇o2peak was lower (by 15–20%) in RTA vs. CTRL. Vastus lateralis fractional O2extraction was lower in RTA vs. CTRL at all work rates, during both CE and KE. RTA had higher ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (56.7 ± 23.7 pmol O2·s−1·mg−1ww) vs. CTRL (35.7 ± 10.2 pmol O2·s−1·mg−1ww) and a tighter coupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

The degree of hypertrophy following RT is, however, highly variable and thus we sought to determine the relationship between the acute activation of MPS and RT-induced hypertrophy. We measured MPS and signalling protein activation after the first session of resistance exercise (RE) in untrained men (n = 23) and then examined the relation between MPS with magnetic resonance image determined hypertrophy. To measure MPS, young men (24±1 yr; body mass index = 26.4±0.9 kg•m2) underwent a primed constant infusion of L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine to measure MPS at rest, and acutely following their first bout of RE prior to 16 wk of RT. Rates of MPS were increased 235±38% (P<0.001) above rest 60–180 min post-exercise and 184±28% (P= 0.037) 180–360 min post exercise. Quadriceps volume increased 7.9±1.6% (−1.9–24.7%) (P<0.001) after training. There was no correlation between changes in quadriceps muscle volume and acute rates of MPS measured over 1–3 h (r = 0.02), 3–6 h (r = 0.16) or the aggregate 1–6 h post-exercise period (r = 0.10). Hypertrophy after chronic RT was correlated (r = 0.42,P= 0.05) with phosphorylation of 4E-BP1Thr37/46at 1 hour post RE. We conclude that acute measures of MPS following an initial exposure to RE in novices are not correlated with muscle hypertrophy following chronic RT.IntroductionSkeletal muscle hypertrophy following resistance training (RT) requires the net addition of new myofibrillar proteins; thus, myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) must exceed myofibrillar protein breakdown (MPB). Using contraction-induced phosphorylation as a proxy for activation and activity, signalling pathway proteins in the Akt (PKB)-mTOR pathway have been measured in humans and some[1], but not all[2], have reported correlations "

We studied the expression patterns of a select group of genes following an acute bout of RE in naïve and hypertrophying muscle. Thirteen untrained subjects underwent supervised RE training for 12 wk of the nondominant arm and performed an acute bout of RE 1 wk after the last bout of the training program (training+acute). The dominant arm was either unexercised (control) or subjected to the same acute exercise bout as the trained arm (acute RE). Following training, men (14.8 ± 2.8%;P< 0.05) and women (12.6 ± 2.4%;P< 0.05) underwent muscle hypertrophy with increases in dynamic strength in the trained arm (48.2 ± 5.4% and 72.1 ± 9.1%, respectively;P< 0.01). RE training resulted in attenuated anabolic signaling as reflected by a reduction in rpS6 phosphorylation following acute RE. Changes in mRNA levels of genes involved in hypertrophic growth, protein degradation, angiogenesis, and metabolism commonly expressed in both men and women was determined 4 h following acute RE. We show that RE training can modify acute RE-induced gene expression in a divergent and gene-specific manner even in genes belonging to the same ontology. Changes in gene expression following acute RE are multidimensional, and may not necessarily reflect the actual adaptive response taking place during the training process. Thus RE training can selectively modify the acute response to RE, thereby challenging the use of gene expression as a marker of exercise-induced adaptations.resistance exercise-inducedskeletal muscle hypertrophy develops following repeated exercise bouts (i.e., the training effect) (13), and this adaptive response results from the cumulative responses to each individual exercise bout (i.e., the acute response) (8). Notably, although this notion, based on the principle of repetition is widely proven and empirically accepted, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) underpinning RE training-induced adaptations. One hypothesis is that following each exercise bout, an acute transcriptional response occurs that will be of higher magnitude following the successive bouts (5). In turn, this will result in the accumulation of cognate proteins (gain of fu"

These may occur due to mechanical constriction of the esophageal lumen or loss of relaxation associated with deglutitive inhibition, as in achalasia-like disorders. Recently, immune inflammation has been identified as an important cause of esophageal strictures and the loss of inhibitory neurotransmission. These disorders are also associated with smooth muscle hypertrophy and hypercontractility, whose cause is unknown. This review investigated immune inflammation in the causation of smooth muscle changes in obstructive esophageal bolus transport. Findings suggest that smooth muscle hypertrophy occurs above the obstruction and is due to mechanical stress on the smooth muscles. The mechanostressed smooth muscles release cytokines and other molecules that may recruit and microlocalize mast cells to smooth muscle bundles, so that their products may have a close bidirectional effect on each other. Acting in a paracrine fashion, the inflammatory cytokines induce genetic and epigenetic changes in the smooth muscles, leading to smooth muscle hypercontractility, hypertrophy, and impaired relaxation. These changes may worsen difficulty in the esophageal transport. Immune processes differ in the first phase of obstructive bolus transport, and the second phase of muscle hypertrophy and hypercontractility. Moreover, changes in the type of mechanical stress may change immune response and effect on smooth muscles. Understanding immune signaling in causes of obstructive bolus transport, type of mechanical stress, and associated smooth muscle changes may help pathophysiology-based prevention and targeted treatment of esophageal motility disorders.INTRODUCTIONThe human esophagus is composed of two distinct regions: the upper or the cervical esophagus, primarily made up of striated muscles, and the lower or the thoracic esophagus, composed of smooth muscles. Consequently, the neuromuscular organization and the mechanism of peristaltic contractions in the two parts are very different. Still, the swallow-induced “primary” peristaltic contraction travels seamlessly through both the parts to transport food bolus to the stomach (1). Additionally, the esophagus propels material refluxed from the stomach back into the stomach using “secondary” peristalsis.Subjects with esophageal disorders have symptoms of dysphagia, chest pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and complications such as esophageal adenocarcinoma and pulmonary disease (2,3). Broadly speaking, the symptoms of dysphagia include all difficulties associated with swallowing. Dysphagia due to obstruction to the passage of food bolus may be due to mechanical constriction of the esophagus or the lo"

Twelve healthy young men (21.8 ± 1.2 yr, body mass index = 23.1 ± 0.6 kg/m2) trained their elbow flexors independently for 15 wk on separate days and under different hormonal milieu. In one training condition, participants performed isolated arm curl exercise designed to maintain basal hormone concentrations (low hormone, LH); in the other training condition, participants performed identical arm exercise to the LH condition followed immediately by a high volume of leg resistance exercise to elicit a large increase in endogenous hormones (high hormone, HH). There was no elevation in serum growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), or testosterone after the LH protocol but significant (P< 0.001) elevations in these hormones immediately and 15 and 30 min after the HH protocol. The hormone responses elicited by each respective exercise protocol late in the training period were similar to the response elicited early in the training period, indicating that a divergent postexercise hormone response was maintained over the training period. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) increased by 12% in LH and 10% in HH (P <0.001) with no difference between conditions (condition × training interaction,P= 0.25). Similarly, type I (P< 0.01) and type II (P< 0.001) muscle fiber CSA increased with training with no effect of hormone elevation in the HH condition.

We conclude that exposure of loaded muscle to acute exercise-induced elevations in endogenous anabolic hormones enhances neither muscle hypertrophy nor strength with resistance training in young men.hormonessuch as testosterone, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) are important for skeletal muscle anabolism during growth and development (e.g.,23).

To cover safety aspects and obtain muscle morphology data, a pilot study was performed in eleven healthy men. Countermovement jump, squat jump, drop jump and one repetition maximum test (1RM) were performed on a force platform before and after a 6 week training period. No severe side effects were found. Repeated needle muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed a selective pre- to post-training type-2 myofiber hypertrophy of up to 50 %. The hypertrophy factors were 160 and 310, for type-2 myofibers. The mechanography system showed a significant increase in the 1RM maximum weight lifted (pre: 111,8 kg ± 11,5; post: 140,9 kg ± 13,00; p < 0,001). Vibration exercise is a safe and effective technique which desires further approval as counter measure in different types of neuromuscular atrophy.Key words:muscle atrophy, muscle biopsy, muscle morphometry, vibration exerciseIntroductionVibration stimulation exercise is a valuable training technique for athletes and counter measurement for any type of induced muscle atrophy. Vibration training is widely used as one of the prevention strategies of muscle aging. Only limited data are available about vibration induced effects on morphology of normal human skeletal muscle. Vibration applied to muscle or tendon induces a non-voluntary muscular contraction termed the \"tonic vibration reflex\" (1). Combined with substantial voluntary effort it was shown to elicit movements in neuromuscular patients who were unable to contract their paretic muscles (2). Vibratory stimulation of the muscle tendon evokes an excitation of muscle spindles mediated by 1a afferents and alpha-motor neurons. Additionally, it is suggested that central motor neuron control organization is activated (3,4). Vibration stimulation of muscle may therefore enhance contraction and post-stimulation facilitation. Subsequently, vibration stimulated training may have positive effects in counter measures of muscle atrophy in spaceflight and disease related muscle atrophy. The aim of this pilot study was to establish morphological and morphometric data on vibration related effects in human muscle in healthy controls.Probands and methodsThe study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board of the University of Munich (vote 103/04). All participants gave written informed consent before they were included in the study.Probands11 healthy, non-elite sportsmen, mostly sport students (mean ± SD age, 26 ± 8.0 years, mean ± SD height, 1.83 m ± 0.06 m, mean ± SD weight; 80.3 ± 3.2 kg) were investigated. All probands had repeated needle muscle biopsies of the lateral vastus muscle before and after a 6-week course of high-frequency vibration training on a vibration platform (Galileo, Novotec medical, Germany). Testing was performed before and after the training intervention jumping power and force were measured by performing a countermovement jump (CMJ), a squat jump (SJ) and a drop jump (DJ), according to Schmidtbleicher (5), on a ground reaction force platform (Leonardo, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany), and a one repetition maximum test (1RM) was performed. The knee ankle during the 1RM squat set at 90° to be accepted. After each successful attempt the load was increased until failure in lifting the load. The probands followed a minimum of two minutes rest between the attempts in the 1RM. The pre test was performed at least two days after the biopsy and the post test at least two days after the last training.TrainingThe 6-week training period consisted of a one week familiarisation period and 5 weeks of training with additional weight, starting with 40% o"

Spangenburg.Author AffiliationsAssistant Professor University of Maryland.to the editor:This is a timely Point:Counterpoint that addresses the role of IGF-I in the regulation of muscle mass. Clearly, IGF-I is critical for muscle development and postnatal muscle growth (2). However, its role in the area of load-induced muscle hypertrophy has been recently questioned (5). There are a few clarifications that should be made, in that the mice used in my study are not knockouts of the IGF-I receptor as implicated by Flüeck and Goldspink (6), but they are transgenic mice that contain a point mutation in the ATP binding domain resulting in abrogated IGF-I receptor function in a dominant negative fashion. Second, one of the key points of my findings was that it was possible for mechanical load to activate mTOR signaling independent of the IGF-I receptor. There are other critical pieces of evidence that must be considered as well. In response to acute loading, the increase in IGF-I production by the muscle occurs over a matter of days (1), while activation of the mTOR signaling is activated in a matter of minutes to hours (4). Furthermore, a major critical aspect of IGF-I signaling is Akt activation; however, the magnitude of phosphorylation and duration of activation of Akt in response to acute mechanical loading is substantially smaller compared to downstream components of mTOR (i.e. p70s6k) (4). Thus, unless IGF-I bypasses Akt to induce protein synthesis, it would suggest that mTOR is likely activated independent of Akt and IGF-I. Stewart and Pell (6) suggest that all muscle growth is dependent on satellite cell activation (6); however, mechanical load can induce smaller increases in muscle mass independent of satellite cell activation (3). Thus, if the major role of IGF-I is to affect satellite cell function and there are cases where we can get growth of muscle without satellite cell activation, then we must conclude IGF-I is not always necessary for muscle growth.REFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein accumulation during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Appl Physiol81: 2509–2516,1996.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar2.Liu JP , Baker J , Perkins AS , Robertson EJ , Efstratiadis A.Mice carrying null mutations of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor I (Igf-1) and type 1 IGF receptor (Igf1r).Cell75: 59–72,1993.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar3.Mitchell PO , Pavlath GK.A muscle precursor cell-dependent pathway contributes to muscle growth after atrophy.Am J Physiol Cell Physiol281: C1706–C1715,2001.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar4.O'Neil TK , Duffy LR , Frey JW , Hornberger TA.The role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphatidic acid in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin following eccentric contractions.J Physiol587: 3691–3701,2009.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar5.Spangenburg EE , Le Roith D , Ward CW , Bodine SC.A functional insulin-like growth factor receptor is not necessary for load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Physiol586: 283–291,2008.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar6.Stewart C , Pell JM , Flueck M , Goldspink G.Point:Counterpoint: IGF is/is not the major physiological regulator of muscle mass.J Appl Physiol. doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01246.2009.Web of Science|Google ScholarREFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein a"

Here, we demonstrate thatNotch3-/-mice have enlarged hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy and mild fibrosis. Cardiomyocytes were hypertrophic but not hyperproliferative, and the expression of several cardiomyocyte markers, includingTnt2,Myh6,Myh7andActn2,was altered. Furthermore, expression of genes regulating the metabolic status of the heart was affected: bothPdk4and Cd36 were downregulated, indicating a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose consumption.Notch3-/-mice furthermore showed lower liver lipid content.Notch3was expressed in heart VSMC and pericytes but not in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that a perturbation of Notch signalling in VSMC and pericytes indirectly impairs the cardiomyocytes. In keeping with this,Pdgfbret/retmice, characterized by reduced numbers of VSMC and pericytes, showed left ventricular and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In conclusion, we demonstrate that reduced Notch3 or PDGFB signalling in vascular mural cells leads to cardiomyocyte dysfunction.Subject terms:Molecular biology, Cell signallingIntroductionNotch signalling is an evolutionarily conserved signalling mechanism, which regulates development and homeostasis of most organs in the body, including the cardiovascular system.

She had also recently undergone an operation for right carpal tunnel syndrome. On exam, she had a bodybuilder-like appearance (Fig.1) without macroglossia. Lab results showed anemia (hemoglobin level, 7.0 g/dL), hypercalcemia (11.5 mg/dL; corrected with albumin), and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with other globulin suppression. Serum creatinine level was 0.80 mg/dL, and creatine kinase (CK) was 126 U/L. An IgD-lambda monoclonal component was detected in serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and bone marrow biopsy revealed atypical plasma cells (69.6 %). She was subsequently diagnosed with IgD myeloma. Computed tomography revealed muscle hypertrophy and infiltrated subcutaneous fat (Fig.2), consistent with amyloidosis.1,2IgD myeloma accounts for only 1–2 % of all myeloma.3Clinical manifestations in IgD myeloma can differ from non-IgD myeloma, including a higher incidence of amyloidosis (44 %) than in other myelomas (15 %).4Differential diagnoses of diffuse skeletal muscle hypertrophy include hypothyroidism and a few neuromuscular disorders such as muscular dystrophies and non-dystrophic myotonic disorders.5Unlike these diseases, serum CK is often normal in patients with amyloidosis.6It is important to consider amyloidosis, in particular when serum CK is not elevated, for the patients whose muscles are hypertrophic without exercise.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabView of the back showing hypertrophic muscles.Fig. 2.Open in a new tabContrast-enhanced computed tomographic image showing hypertrophy of the erector spinae muscles (arrow) and soft tissue infiltration in subcutaneous fat (arrowhead).Compliance with Ethical StandardsConflict of InterestThe authors declare that they do not have a conflict of interest.REFERENCES1.Lima I, De Jesus TA, Galrao L, Santiago MB.

The amplitude of KATPchannels induced by the KATPchannel opener pinacidil (10 μM) was greater in ASMCs from control than from hypertrophied animals. In phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings, pinacidil induced relaxation in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-dependent curve was shifted to the right in the hypertrophied (EC50: 17.80 ± 3.28 μM) compared with the control model (EC50: 6.69 ± 2.40 μM). Although the level of Kir6.2 subtype expression did not differ between ASMCs from the control and hypertrophied models, those of the Kir6.1 and SUR2B subtypes were decreased in the hypertrophied model. Application of the calcitonin-gene related peptide (100 nM) and adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10 μM), which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and consequently KATPchannels, induced a KATPcurrent in both control and hypertrophied animals; however, the KATPcurrent amplitude did not differ between the two groups. Furthermore, PKA expression was not altered between the control and hypertrophied animals. These results suggests that the decreased KATPcurrent amplitude and KATPchannel-induced vasorelaxation in the hypertrophied animals were attributable to the reduction in KATPchannel expression but not to changes in the intracellular signaling mechanism that activates the KATPcurrent.cardiac hypertrophy,which is considered to be an active adaptation mechanism to excessiv"

Here, we examined the levels of autophagy signaling proteins after 7 days of overload hypertrophy in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles of control and diabetic rats. We compared control and 3‐day streptozotocin‐induced diabetic rats, an experimental model for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). EDL muscles showed increased levels of basal autophagy signaling proteins. The diabetic state did not affect the extent of overload‐induced hypertrophy or the levels of autophagy signaling proteins (p‐ULK1, Beclin‐1, Atg5, Atg12‐5, Atg7, Atg3, LC3‐I and II, and p62) in either muscle. The p‐ULK‐1, Beclin‐1, and p62 protein expression levels were higher in the EDL muscle than in the soleus before the hypertrophic stimulus. On the contrary, the soleus muscle exhibited increased autophagic signaling after overload‐induced hypertrophy, with increases in Beclin‐1, Atg5, Atg12‐5, Atg7, Atg3, and LC3‐I expression in the control and diabetic groups, in addition to p‐ULK‐1 in the control groups. After hypertrophy, Beclin‐1 and Atg5 levels increased in the EDL m"

Spangenburg.Author AffiliationsAssistant Professor University of Maryland.to the editor:This is a timely Point:Counterpoint that addresses the role of IGF-I in the regulation of muscle mass. Clearly, IGF-I is critical for muscle development and postnatal muscle growth (2). However, its role in the area of load-induced muscle hypertrophy has been recently questioned (5). There are a few clarifications that should be made, in that the mice used in my study are not knockouts of the IGF-I receptor as implicated by Flüeck and Goldspink (6), but they are transgenic mice that contain a point mutation in the ATP binding domain resulting in abrogated IGF-I receptor function in a dominant negative fashion. Second, one of the key points of my findings was that it was possible for mechanical load to activate mTOR signaling independent of the IGF-I receptor. There are other critical pieces of evidence that must be considered as well. In response to acute loading, the increase in IGF-I production by the muscle occurs over a matter of days (1), while activation of the mTOR signaling is activated in a matter of minutes to hours (4). Furthermore, a major critical aspect of IGF-I signaling is Akt activation; however, the magnitude of phosphorylation and duration of activation of Akt in response to acute mechanical loading is substantially smaller compared to downstream components of mTOR (i.e. p70s6k) (4). Thus, unless IGF-I bypasses Akt to induce protein synthesis, it would suggest that mTOR is likely activated independent of Akt and IGF-I. Stewart and Pell (6) suggest that all muscle growth is dependent on satellite cell activation (6); however, mechanical load can induce smaller increases in muscle mass independent of satellite cell activation (3). Thus, if the major role of IGF-I is to affect satellite cell function and there are cases where we can get growth of muscle without satellite cell activation, then we must conclude IGF-I is not always necessary for muscle growth.REFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein accumulation during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Appl Physiol81: 2509–2516,1996.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar2.Liu JP , Baker J , Perkins AS , Robertson EJ , Efstratiadis A.Mice carrying null mutations of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor I (Igf-1) and type 1 IGF receptor (Igf1r).Cell75: 59–72,1993.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar3.Mitchell PO , Pavlath GK.A muscle precursor cell-dependent pathway contributes to muscle growth after atrophy.Am J Physiol Cell Physiol281: C1706–C1715,2001.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar4.O'Neil TK , Duffy LR , Frey JW , Hornberger TA.The role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphatidic acid in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin following eccentric contractions.J Physiol587: 3691–3701,2009.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar5.Spangenburg EE , Le Roith D , Ward CW , Bodine SC.A functional insulin-like growth factor receptor is not necessary for load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Physiol586: 283–291,2008.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar6.Stewart C , Pell JM , Flueck M , Goldspink G.Point:Counterpoint: IGF is/is not the major physiological regulator of muscle mass.J Appl Physiol. doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01246.2009.Web of Science|Google ScholarREFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein a"

However, stretch combined with overload, as in eccentric contractions, is an effective stimulus for inducing physiological and neural adaptations to training. Eccentric exercise-induced adaptations include muscle hypertrophy, increased cortical activity, and changes in motor unit behavior, all of which contribute to improved muscle function. In this brief review, neuromuscular adaptations to different forms of exercise are reviewed, the positive training effects of eccentric exercise are presented, and the implications for training are considered.1. IntroductionNeuromuscular and functional changes induced by exercise are specific to the mode of exercise performed. The degree of mechanical tension, subcellular damage, and metabolic stress can all play a role in exercise-induced muscle adaptations [1–5]. Of the three types of muscle contractions that can be utilized during exercise (concentric, isometric, and eccentric), eccentric exercises are those actions in which the muscle lengthens under tension. During eccentric contractions the load on the muscle is greater than the force developed by the muscle and the muscle is stretched, producing a lengthening contraction. Eccentric exercise is characterized by muscle microlesions and greater mechanical tension as compared to concentric/isometric contractions and therefore may result in greater muscle adaptations. Although all forms of exercise may induce impressive muscle adaptation, it is not always clear which method is best for maximizing adaptation gains. This paper provides a brief overview of studies documenting physiological (metabolic, histochemical) and neural adaptations in response to exercise training, with an emphasis on eccentric exercise.2. Exercise Training and Physiological AdaptationsHigh intensity resistance training is associated with significant physiological adaptations within skeletal muscle [6] including changes in the contractile and/or noncontractile elements of muscle. When mechanical overload of muscle occurs, the myofibers and extracellular matrix are disturbed, which in turn stimulates a process of protein synthesis [7]. Mechanical tension induced by high intensity exercise can also increase the rate of metabolic stress and stimulate subcellular pathways involved in protein synthesis such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which may play a role in exercise-induced muscle growth [1,2]. The total number of sarcomeres in parallel and in series increase resulting in an increase in fascicle length and pennation angle and, consequently, muscle hypertrophy. It has been proposed that stretch combined with overload is the most effective stimulus for promoting muscle growth [8,9]. During eccentric exercise, skeletal muscle is subjected to both stretch and overload which triggers subcellular damage to the contractile and structural components of skeletal muscle [10,11]. This subcellular damage induces a sequence of physiological events including the activation of master signaling pathways for gene expression and muscle hypertrop"

Recently, TCTP has also been proposed to act as an indirect activator of mTOR. While it is known that mTOR plays a major role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, very little is known about the role and regulation of TCTP in this post-mitotic tissue. This study shows that muscle TCTP and mTOR signaling are upregulated in a range of mouse models (mdxmouse, mechanical load-induced hypertrophy, and denervation- and immobilization-induced atrophy). Furthermore, the increase in TCTP observed in the hypertrophic and atrophic conditions occurred, in part, via a rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-dependent mechanism. However, the overexpression of TCTP was not sufficient to activate mTOR signaling (or increase protein synthesis) and is thus unlikely to take part in a recently proposed positive feedback loop with mTOR. Nonetheless, TCTP overexpression was sufficient to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy. Finally, TCTP overexpression inhibited the promoter activity of the muscle-specific ubiquitin proteasome E3-ligase, MuRF1, suggesting that TCTP may play a role in inhibiting protein degradation. These findings provide novel data on the role and regulation of TCTP in skeletal musclein vivo.Keywords:muscle hypertrophy, muscle atrophy, cancer, duchenne muscular dystrophy, proteostasisINTRODUCTIONThe highly conserved translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP; a.k.a. p21, p23, Q23, and fortilin) was initially identified as a mitogen-stimulated protein whose mRNA was found in untranslated messenger ribonucleoprotein particles [1–5]. Since then, many studies have shown that TCTP is a regulator of cellular growth and proliferation, and that it is upregulated in a range of different cancer cell types [6–13]. Furthermore, the knockdown of TCTP has been shown to induce"

Mice were subjected to functional overload of the plantaris by bilateral removal of the synergist muscles. Mechanical loading resulted in muscle hypertrophy with an increase in rRNA content. rDNA transcription, as determined by 45S pre-rRNA abundance, paralleled the increase in rRNA content and was consistent with the onset of the hypertrophic response. Increased transcription and protein expression of c-Myc and its downstream polymerase I (Pol I) regulon (POL1RB, TIF-1A, PAF53, TTF1, TAF1C) was also consistent with the increase in rRNA. Similarly, factors involved in rDNA transcription, such as the upstream binding factor and the Williams syndrome transcription factor, were induced by mechanical loading in a corresponding temporal fashion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that these factors, together with Pol I, were enriched at the rDNA promoter. This, in addition to an increase in histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, demonstrates that mechanical loading regulates rRNA synthesis by inducing a gene expression program consisting of a Pol I regulon, together with accessory factors involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling at the rDNA promoter. Altogether, these data indicate that transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms take place in the regulation of ribosome production at the onset of muscle hypertrophy.skeletal muscle hypertrophyrequires an increase in the number of ribosomes to cope with the anabolic demands of the growth process. Enhanced ribosome production seems necessary as blockage of de novo rRNA synthesis severely restricts muscle hypertrophy in vivo (10) and in vitro (20). Despite the importance of ribosome production during hypertrophy, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process and how this is modulated by mechanical loading.Synthesis of functional ribosomes requires the coordinated expression of four different rRNA subunits and ∼80 ribosomal proteins. All rRNA subunits are transcriptionally regulated, and of all of these, the 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA subunits are processed from a single 45S pre-rRNA, which originates from transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) (13). Pol I transcription of rDNA genes is rate limiting for growth (19), and its association with the rDNA promoter depends, to a large extent, on the formation of a preinitiation complex (PIC) (25). This complex is composed of multiple factors that operate in synergy to modulate transcriptional efficiency through"

Hypertrophy can be induced by mechanical stress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that MURC mediates hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes under mechanical stress. We used the in vivo model of an aortocaval shunt (AV shunt) in adult Wistar rats to induce myocardial hypertrophy. We also used the in vitro model of cyclic stretch in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes to clarify MURC expression and the molecular regulation mechanism. The flexible membrane culture plate seeding with cardiomyocytes Cardiomyocytes seeded on a flexible membrane culture plate were stretched by vacuum pressure to 20% of maximum elongation at 60 cycles/min. AV shunt induction enhanced MURC protein expression in the left ventricular myocardium. Treatment with atorvastatin inhibited the hypertrophy induced by the AV shunt. Cyclic stretch markedly enhanced MURC protein and mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes. Addition of extracellular‐signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059, ERK small interfering RNA (siRNA), angiotensin II (Ang II) antibody and atorvastatin before stretch, abolished the induction of MURC protein. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that stretch enhanced the DNA binding activity of serum response factor. Stretch increased but MURC mutant plasmid, ERK siRNA, Ang II antibody and atorvastatin reversed the transcriptional activity of MURC induced by stretch. Adding Ang II to the cardiomyocytes also induced MURC protein expression. MURC siRNA and atorvastatin inhibited the hypertrophic marker and protein synthesis induced by stretch. Treatment with atorvastatin reversed MURC expression and hypertrophy under volume overload and cyclic stretch.Keywords:atorvastatin, cyclic stretch, MURC, volume overload1. INTRODUCTIONCardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive mechanism of increase in cardiomyocyte size under haemodynamic overload of the heart.1Haemodynamic load is a crucial regulator of cardiac function and gene expression. If the haemodynamic overload is prolonged, hypertrophy ultimately leads to heart failure and death. There are two types of hypertrophy in response to haemodynamic overload. Pressure overload‐mediated concentric hypertrophy leads to a normal left ventricular volume and an increase in wall thickness.2However, the eccentric hypertrophy induced by volume overload causes an increase in the left ventricular volume while not affecting the wall thickness.3Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of studies concerned with the molecular mechanism of hypertrophy, especially in concentric hypertrophy induced by pressure overload.4However, the molecular regulation mechanism of eccentric hypertrophy caused by volume overload is still not fully understood.5MURC ("

We cultured C2C12 cells with either lactate or LC for 6 h. We found that lactate significantly increased myogenin and follistatin protein levels and phosphorylation of P70S6K while decreasing the levels of myostatin relative to the control. LC significantly increased protein levels of Pax7, MyoD, and Ki67 in addition to myogenin, relative to control. LC also significantly increased follistatin expression relative to control and stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR and P70S6K. In an in vivo study, male F344/DuCrlCrlj rats were assigned to control (Sed,n= 10), exercise (Ex,n= 12), and LC supplementation (LCEx,n= 13) groups. LC was orally administered daily. The LCExand Ex groups were exercised on a treadmill, running for 30 min at low intensity every other day for 4 wk. The LCExgroup experienced a significant increase in the mass of the gastrocnemius (GA) and tibialis anterior (TA) relative to both the Sed and Ex groups. Furthermore, the LCExgroup showed a significant increase in the total DNA content of TA compared with the Sed group. The LCExgroup experienced a significant increase in myogenin and follistatin expression of GA relative to the Ex group. These results suggest that administration of LC can effectively increase muscle mass concomitant with elevated numbers of myonuclei, even with low-intensity exercise training, via activated satellite cells and anabolic signals.satellite cells are myogenicprecursor cells located between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina of muscle fibers.

Myostatin-deficient mice have been used as a model for studying muscle-bone interactions, and here we review the skeletal phenotype associated with altered myostatin signaling. It is now known that myostatin is a key regulator of mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and mice lacking the myostatin gene show decreased body fat and a generalized increase in bone density and strength. The increase in bone density is observed in most anatomical regions, including the limbs, spine, and jaw, and myostatin inhibitors have been observed to significantly increase bone formation. Myostatin is also expressed in the early phases of fracture healing, and myostatin deficiency leads to increased fracture callus size and strength. Together, these data suggest that myostatin has direct effects on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, and that myostatin antagonists and inhibitors are likely to enhance both muscle mass and bone strength.Keywords:GDF-8, ActRIIB, bone density, hypertrophy, muscle-bone interactionsIntroductionMyostatin (GDF-8), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors, is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth [1]. Loss of myostatin function is associated with an increase in muscle mass in mice, cows, and humans [2,3], and myostatin blockade improves muscle regeneration in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The effect of myostatin is dose-dependent, as mice heterozygous for the disrupted myostatin sequence have intermediate muscle weights between normal mice and mice homozygous for the myostatin mutation [4]. During embryogenesis myostatin expression is restricted to developing skeletal muscles, but myostatin is still expressed and secreted by skeletal muscles during adult life [1]. Myostatin circulates in the blood in a latent form bound to a propeptide, which gets cleaved by BMP1/Tolloid matrix metalloproteinase releasing the active form. Follistatin and follistatin–related gene (FLRG) are other proteins that can bind and inhibit the activity of myostatin by maintaining its latency [2,5]. Active myostatin binds to its receptor, type IIB activin receptor (ActRIIB), with high affinity and regulates the expression of its target genes through a TGF-β signaling pathway. Recent studies also show that myostatin can activate the p38 MAPK, Erk1/2, and Wnt pathways [6–8].It has long been recognized that increased muscle mass and strength are associated with a resultant increase in bone mass [9–11]. Experimental investigations into this relationship have generally employed vigorous exercise or some other means of varying muscle-induced stimuli on bone [12–15]. The myostatin-deficient mouse model has provided a novel and unique approach for examining the effects of increased muscle mass on bone independent of the confounding variables associated with changes in physical activity. The body composition of mice lacking myostatin is now generally well characterized, and myostatin-deficient mice show an increase in muscle mass and decreased fat mass [4,16]. The myostatin-deficient mice referenced in this review are produced by homozygous deletion of the C-terminal region of the myostatin gene in embryonic stem cells [1]. We discuss below the different studies performed on myostatin-deficient mice in assessment of the effects of loss of myostatin function and increased muscle mass on bone mass, architecture, and regeneration, briefly summarized infigure 1.Fig.1.Open in a new tabSummary of bony phenotypic changes associated with loss of myostatin function in mice.

MRI showed hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle due to an underlying gluteus minimus tendon tear.Abductor tendon tears can present with swelling of the thigh due to secondary tensor fasciae latae muscle hypertrophy.Keywords:Orthopaedics, Radiology, Orthopaedic and trauma surgeryBackgroundIn this case, we report our experience with an uncommon cause of swelling of the upper thigh: hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle secondary to a small abductor tear. To our knowledge, this has never been described in previous reports.Case presentationA 68-year-old man with no relevant medical history (eg, no lower limb surgery or trauma) was referred to our outpatient clinic because of a gradually growing swelling on the right anterolateral thigh. He noticed the swelling a year before and was worried about the possible underlying cause. He reported no trauma related to this complaint. He had no pain and an unlimited range of motion of his hip and knee.Physical examination showed a diffuse not mobile swelling, localised over the tensor fasciae latae muscle, and the overlying skin showed no abnormalities.InvestigationsAn X-ray showed a normal aspect of the femur. An additional MRI (figure 1) showed unilateral hypertrophy of the right tensor fasciae latae muscle. The only other abnormality was an incomplete tear of the right gluteus minimus tendon (figure 2).Figure 1.Open in a new tabT1-weighted transverse MRI of the pelvic area. At the location of the fiducial, which was placed on the swelling, a hypertrophic right tensior fasciae latae muscle was identified.Figure 2.Open in a new tabT1-weighted coronal MRI of the pelvic area showing an incomplete tear of the right gluteus minimus tendon.Differential diagnosisA wide scale of diagnoses can cause a soft tissue mass in the upper leg. This includes different benign and malignant tumours and neoplasm mimicking diseases.1TreatmentBecause of the absence of pain, limping or impaired range of motion only regular abductor training was started.Outcome and follow-upAt follow-up examination 2 and 6 months after diagnosis, the patient was still without limitations regarding the right hip and the tensor fasciae latae hypertrophy remained visible.DiscussionIn this case, it was presumed that a small tear of the gluteus minimus tendon was the underlying cause of the hypertrophic tensor fasciae latae muscle. The tensor fasciae latae muscle appears to compensate the partial loss of abduction in the hip.To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient solely presenting with an asymptomatic swelling of the musculus tensor fasciae latae due to a small hip abductor tendon tear. A recent retrospective study of MRI imaging for hip abductor tendon tears also showed hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle in comparison to the contralateral hip. However, contrary to our case, all patients were symptomatic (pain or muscle weakness).2Another study that retrospectively reviewed eight patients with a proximal anterior thigh mass showed eight cases of musculus tensor fasciae latae hypertrophy. In six cases, they found a cause; prior surgery with altered weight bearing mechanics, biopsy confirmed myopathy and diabetic peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy. In none of these cases abductor tendon tears were reported.3Our study emphasises on one of the multiple compensatory mechanisms in the human body. To exclude serious illness, we suggest further analysis with MRI in patients presenting with soft tissue swelling of the anterolateral upper thigh. In this case, the patient remained asymptomatic, possibly because of regular abducto"

All rights reserved.PMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC4339313 NIHMSID: NIHMS658630 PMID:25632833The publisher's version of this article is available atLife SciAbstractAerobic exercise training (AET) attenuates or reverses pathological cardiac remodeling after insults such as chronic hypertension and myocardial infarction. The phenotype of the pathologically hypertrophied heart depends on the insult; therefore, it is likely that distinct types of pathological hypertrophy require different exercise regimens. However, the mechanisms by which AET improves the structure and function of the pathologically hypertrophied heart are not well understood, and exercise research uses highly inconsistent exercise regimens in diverse patient populations. There is a clear need for systematic research to identify precise exercise prescriptions for different conditions of pathological hypertrophy. Therefore, this review synthesizes existing evidence for the distinct mechanisms by which AET benefits the heart in different pathological hypertrophy conditions, suggests strategic exercise prescriptions for these conditions, and highlights areas for future research.Keywords:aerobic exercise, cardiac hypertrophy, exercise prescription, pathological hypertrophy, physiological hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, diabetic cardiomyopathyINTRODUCTIONCardiac hypertrophy is enlargement of the heart that occurs in response to metabolic stress, hemodynamic insults, or inherent genetic defects. It is characterized by increases in ventricular wall thickness and/or internal chamber dimensions. With the exception of the physiological hypertrophy that occurs in response to pregnancy or exercise, hypertrophic cardiac remodeling is a response to a pathological condition, and precedes or causes impaired cardiac function (Bernardo et al. 2010). However, the prognoses as well as the structural, metabolic, and functional phenotypes of different hypertrophic disorders are distinct, and depend on the initial insult as well as the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities(Figure 1).Figure 1. Phenotypes of physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Open in a new tab(A) Chronic pathological insults such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and chronic diabetes result in morphologically distinct types of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. (B) Physiological stimuli such as exercise and pregnancy induce physiological cardiac enlargement, or hypertrophy. Tan areas indicate fibrotic lesions. Orange areas indicate fatty streaks.Aerobic exercise training (AET) reduces the risk of cardiac events with an efficacy comparable to pharmacological therapy (Naci et al. 2013). Increasingly, AET is prescribed for the prevention, management, or rehabilitation of those cardiovascular diseases that are characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, including hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), and diabetic cardiomyopathy (Hordern et al. 2012,Mezzani et al. 2012). The rationale for prescribing AET is based on evidence that it reduces cardiovascular mortality and cardiac event recidivism rates, and improves cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and overweight (Nohria et al. 2002,Taylor et al. 2004,Clark et al. 2010,Lawler et al. 2011). Translational studies have shown that improvements in cardiovascular risk factors can be improved by both interval-based and continuous AET (Haram et al. 2009,Tjønna et al. 2009,Wisloff et al. 2009). Therefore, a key question is what modes and intensities of exercise elicit the greatest benefit i"

Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac aging is a great challenge for biologists and physicians worldwide. In this review, we discuss several key molecular mechanisms of cardiac aging and possible prevention and treatment methods developed in recent years. Insights into the process and mechanism of cardiac aging are necessary to protect against age-related diseases, extend lifespan, and reduce the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in elderly individuals. We believe that research on cardiac aging is entering a new era of unique significance for the progress of clinical medicine and social welfare.1. IntroductionAccording to “World Population Prospects 2019: Highlights,” elderly people above 65 years of age accounted for approximately 9.09% of the global population in 2019 and are expected to increase to 16.67% by 2050 as a result of declining fertility and mortality rates. In Japan, the most aging country in the world, the proportion of the population aged 65 and above has incr"

Signaling via mTOR is crucial for ribosome production and hypertrophy; however, the mechanisms by which it regulates these processes remain to be identified. Herein, we investigated the activation of mTOR signaling in hypertrophying myotubes and determined that mTOR coordinates various aspects of gene expression important for ribosome production. First, inhibition of translation with cycloheximide had a more potent effect on protein synthesis than rapamycin indicating that mTOR function during hypertrophy is not on general, but rather on specific protein synthesis. Second, blocking Pol II transcription had a similar effect as Rapamycin and, unexpectedly, revealed the necessity of Pol II transcription for Pol I transcription, suggesting that mTOR may regulate ribosome production also by controlling Class II genes at the transcriptional level. Third, Pol I activity is essential for rDNA transcription and, surprisingly, for protein synthesis as selective Pol I inhibition blunted rDNA transcription, protein synthesis, and the hypertrophic response of myotubes. Finally, mTOR has nuclear localization in muscle, which is not sensitive to rapamycin. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin disrupted mTOR-rDNA promoter interaction and resulted in altered histone marks indicative of repressed transcription and formation of higher-order chromatin structure. Thus mTOR signaling appears to regulate muscle hypertrophy by affecting protein synthesis, Class I and II gene expression, and chromatin remodeling.de novoribosome production is an early event during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The increase in protein synthetic capacity is needed to sustain muscle protein accretion and is directly proportional to muscle protein synthesis rates (25). At the onset of muscle hypertrophy preceding any measureable protein accretion (20), increased ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) leads to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) accumulation, and an increase in ribosome content (41). This involves the activity of all three transcription systems: RNA Polymerase (Pol) I generates a primary transcript from the 45S ribosomal (r)DNA genes to produce 18S, 5.8 S, and 28S rRNA; Pol II transcription is responsible for synthesizing all r-proteins mRNAs and accessory factors required for rRNA processing; and Pol III transcribes 5S an"

These pathways are initiated at the cell membrane and work their way to the nucleus to mediate gene expression. Complexity is multiplied as the cardiomyocyte is subjected to cross talk with other cells as well as a barrage of extracellular stimuli and mechanical stresses. In this review, we summarize the signaling cascades that play key roles in cardiac function and then we proceed to describe emerging concepts of how the cardiomyocyte senses the mechanical and environmental stimuli to transition to the deleterious genetic program that defines pathologic cardiac remodeling. As a highlighting example of these processes, we illustrate the transition from a compensated hypertrophied myocardium to a decompensated failing myocardium, which is clinically manifested as decompensated heart failure.Keywords:Cardiomyopathy, Heart failure, Signaling pathway, Transcription, MicroRNAs, Gene expressionIntroductionThe cardiomyocyte constitutes approximately one third of the cellular makeup of the heart, but accounts for three quarters of the myocardial volume [1]. The heart, and in the particular the cardiomyocyte, is subjected to a barrage of stimuli; the response of the cardiomyocyte to these stimuli dictates the function of the organ, and ultimately the host. The cardiomyocyte is a terminally differentiated cell. Upon insult such as infarction, the remaining cardiomyocytes cannot undergo hyperplasia. Instead, the remaining cardiomyocytes can increase protein synthesis, cell size, the number of sarcomeres, the number of contractile proteins, and the number of mitochondria [2]. The hypertrophy and elongation of the cardiomyocyte is reflected in the increased mass of the ventricle.The adult heart undergoes “physiological hypertrophy” in response to pregnancy and exercise. Physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli act upon membrane-bound receptors that in turn activate intracellular signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, calcineurin-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), insulin-like growth factor-I–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt/protein kinase B, amongst others. The cascades elicited by these stimuli are ultimately reflected at the gene transcription level. [3–8]The pathologic responses that the heart can be exposed to include, but are not limited to inflammation (myocarditis), ischemia, ischemia–reperfusion injury, biomechanical stress, excess neurohormonal activation, excess afterload (hypertension, aortic stenosis), and cytokine storm amongst others [2]. Cardiac remodeling is a complex process that summarizes the alterations in cardiac structure, shape, and function that result from pathologic stimuli. Cardiac remodeling encompasses the changes at the cellular and gene expression that occur upon insult. Grossly, the size, shape, and thickness changes that constitute cardiac remodeling influence the ventricular function and prognosis following insult [9–11]. The extracellular matrix, cellular architecture (comprising the sarcomeres), and genetic programs all contribute to this process. Remodeling encompasses both the acute events following insult (within 90 min of an ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) as well as the long-standing events (lasting up to months or even years following the insult) [1]. Cardiac remodeling is mediated by cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, immune cells, and the endothelial cells [12].There are two manifestations of hemodynamic overload mediated cardiac hypertrophy: [9].Hypertension and aortic stenosis impartPressure Overload. At the cellular level, this leads to the addition of sarcomeres in parallel, increased myocyte cross-sectional area, and pronounced ventricular wall thickening. Grossly, clinicians refer to this as concentric hypertrophy.Mitral"

Currently, HCM is diagnosed if there is unexplained left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with LV wall thickness ≥15 mm in probands or ≥13 mm in at-risk relatives. Although LV hypertrophy is a key feature, this binary metric does not encompass the full constellation of phenotypic features, particularly in the subclinical stage of the disease. Subtle phenotypic manifestations can be identified in sarcomere variant carriers with normal LV wall thickness, before diagnosis with HCM (G+/LV hypertrophy−; subclinical HCM). We conducted a systematic review to summarize current knowledge about the phenotypic spectrum of subclinical HCM and factors influencing penetrance and expressivity. Although the mechanisms driving the development of LV hypertrophy are yet to be elucidated, activation of profibrotic pathways, impaired relaxation, abnormal Ca2+signaling, altered myocardial energetics, and microvascular dysfunction have all been identified in subclinical HCM. Progression from subclinical to clinically overt HCM may be more likely if early phenotypic manifestations are present, including ECG abnormalities, longer mitral valve leaflets, lower global E’ velocities on Doppler echocardiography, and higher serum N-terminal propeptide of B-type natriuretic peptide. Longitudinal studies of variant carriers are critically needed to improve our understanding of penetrance, characterize the transition to disease, identify risk predictors of phenotypic evolution, and guide the development of novel treatment strategies aimed at influencing disease trajectory.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder that is frequently caused by pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in genes associated with the sarcomere apparatus. Genetic testing identifies a P/LP variant in 30% to 40% of adults with a clinical diagnosis of HCM, but >60% of patients diagnosed during childhood or with a family history of HCM have a P/LP.1,2The most commonly involved genes are myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), troponin T (TNNT2), and troponin I (TNNI3;Table). However, not all variant carriers (G+) demonstrate clinically overt HCM (left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH+]) as penetrance (the percentage [%] of G+ who have LVH in cross-sectional studies) and phenotypic conversion (% of G+ who develop LVH during short- to medium-term longitudinal follow-up) are variable, influenced by age, the specific gene, and clinical context, among other currently unidentified genetic and environmental factors.Table.

Although LVH is a key feature, this binary definition of disease does not account for concurrent features that impact LV wall thickness, such as sex, ethnic background, comorbidities, or body size, leading to both under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis. The definition does not recognize that the disease is a continuum and that the absence of LVH cannot be translated to no phenotype in sarcomere variant carriers. A dichotomous cutoff also fails to encompass the complex phenotypic spectrum of HCM, which extends beyond simple alteration of LV wall thickness. Phenotypic manifestations of sarcomere variants "

The Journal of Physiology © 2015 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC4575564 PMID:26331830‘Pathological’ cardiac hypertrophy is a condition that is characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, a decrease in the size of the chambers of the heart, and a reduced capacity of the heart to pump blood to the tissues and organs around the body. Two common causes of pathological cardiac hypertrophy are high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart valve stenosis, and this type of hypertrophy is considered to be a major independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality (Meijset al.2010). On the other hand, ‘physiological’ cardiac hypertrophy can be provoked by exercise training and can lead to increase cardiac size that is characterized by normal cardiac morphology with a normal and/or enhanced cardiac function (Ooiet al.2014). In addition, exercise training has been shown to be the only practical and sustainable countermeasure capable of providing cardioprotection by improving myocardial tolerance to ischaemia–reperfusion injury (e.g. heart attack) (Powerset al.2014).Although both types of cardiac hypertrophy are initiated by an overload to the heart, the distinct differences between the two can be attributed to the type of overloading stimuli. However, data also implicate duration and intensity of the cardiac overload in determining whether the cardiac hypertrophy that develops is ‘pathological’ or ‘physiological’. Indeed, even the benefits of exercise can be dose dependent. For example, very high intensity/duration exercise can result in unfavourable cardiac structural and electrical cardiac remodelling.In this issue ofThe Journal of Physiology, a group of researchers form Portugal performed a study to address the question of whether submitting the heart to intermittent and tolerable amounts of stress, independent of its nature, could induce a cardiac phenotype that would fit within the ‘physiological’ spectrum (Moreira-Goncalveset al.2015). To answer their question the authors compared three groups of animals: (1) Sedentary+Placebo, (2) Exercise, and (3) Sedentary+Dobutamine (simulated exercise: similar haemodynamic demand to the exercise group). Following an 8 week protocol, the authors collected data at rest and during cardiac overload induced by banding of the aorta. The exercise and simulated exercise groups had lower body weight, faster cardiac relaxation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and improved mitochondrial complex IV and V activity. The latter finding is of particular importance because it can indicate an enhanced capacity to support cardiomyocyte energetic cost without compromising the ATP that is needed to maintain intracellular homeostasis.In summary, the authors’ results show that regardless of the nature of the controlled intermittent cardiac overload the heart responds favourably and undergoes adaptive hypertrophy. Importantly, the adaptive and ‘physiological’ hypertrophy in both the exercise and simulated exercise groups protected against an acute pressure overload insult. In conclusion, I am in full agreement with the authors’ statement that we need further research to fully elucidate why some cardiac overloading stimuli are beneficial while others are deleterious.Additional informationCompeting interestsNone declared.ReferencesMeijs MF, Vergouwe Y, Cramer MJ, Vonken EJ, Velthuis BK, Verton DJ, van der Graaf Y, Visseren FL, Mali WP, Doevendans PA, Bots ML SMART study group.

Thoracic outlet syndrome of the arterial type may appear with symptoms of hand pain due to the aneurismal part of the compressed SCA. The current cadaveric case describes a hypertrophic right-sided anterior scalene muscle (ASM) and the possible entrapment of the right SCA (RSCA) passing through its fibres. Furthermore, the branching pattern of the entrapped vessel is analysed.Case Report.A hypertrophic ASM was identified in the right infraclavicular area of a male Greek donated cadaver (70 years of age). The RSCA passed through the ASM belly, and some deeply situated fibres extended posteriorly to the RSCA. The ASM compressed the RSCA against the superior part of the 1strib.Conclusion.Knowledge of such variants may be important in the diagnosis of upper limb muscle atrophy or neurosensory loss.Keywords:Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Anterior Scalene Muscle, Variant, Compression, Subclavian ArteryIntroductionThe presence of some anatomical variants, such as cervical ribs, 1strib anomalies, hypertrophy of the cervical muscles in combination with repetitive motion, as well as fibrocartilaginous bands (1-3) may cause subclavian artery (SCA) entrapment and/or compression (2,4-8). In addition, the atypical passage of the SCA through the anterior scalene muscle (ASM) or posterior to it (9,10) may cause compression on the SCA.Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), an extensively studied entity, includes a constellation of disorders that arise from the compression of the brachial plexus, and/or the subclavian and axillary vessels within the thoracic outlet, due to the narrow apertures and compartments created by the first rib inferiorly, the surrounding musculature and the clavicle, as well as the anterior and middle scalene muscles (11,12). TOS sites of compression are the interscalene triangle, followed by the costoclavicular triangle or the subcoracoid and pectoralis minor space (1,13). The arterial form of the syndrome includes hand pain due to the aneurismal part of the compressed SCA. It is also characterized by chronic and repetitive SCA compression, which may"

Mice were placed in a hypoxia chamber, and the oxygen was lowered by 1% every day for 14 days to reach 7% oxygen. The animals remained in 7% oxygen for 2 weeks before terminal studies. Myocyte proliferation was also studied with a mosaic analysis with double markers mouse model.Results:Hypoxia induced cardiac hypertrophy in both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocytes, with LV myocytes lengthening and RV myocytes widening and lengthening. Hypoxia induced an increase (0.01±0.01% in normoxia to 0.11±0.09% in hypoxia) in the number of EdU+ RV cardiomyocytes, with no effect on LV myocytes in male C57BL/6 mice. Similar results were observed in female mice. Furthermore, in mosaic analysis with double markers mice, hypoxia induced a significant increase in RV myocyte proliferation (0.03±0.03% in normoxia to 0.32±0.15% in hypoxia of RFP+ myocytes), with no significant change in LV myocyte proliferation. RNA sequencing showed upregulation of mitotic cell cycle genes and a downregulation of Cullin genes, which promote the G1 to S phase transition in hypoxic mice. There was significant proliferation of nonmyocytes and mild cardiac fibrosis in hypoxic mice that did not disrupt cardiac function. Male and female mice exhibited similar gene expression following hypoxia.Conclusions:Systemic hypoxia induces a global hypertrophic stress response that was associated with increased RV proliferation, and while LV myocytes did not show increased proliferation, our results minimally confirm previous reports that hypoxia can induce cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in vivo.Graphical AbstractNovelty and SignificanceWhat Is Known?•Myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases, cause the death of cardiac muscle cells and this can lead to abnormal heart function, heart failure and premature death.•The adult heart is unable to replenish cardiac muscle cells that die with disease stress, in large part because adult cardiac myocytes rarely proliferate.•A recent study23showed that chronic systemic hypoxia (7% oxygen) in adult male mice induces ventricular myocyte proliferation, suggesting that hypoxia could be used as a therapy to replace ventricular myocytes lost with disease.What New Information Does This Article Contribute?•Hypoxemia in both adult male and female mice caused a small increase in the proliferation of right ventricular (RV) cardiomyocytes but had no effect on left ventricular (LV) myocyte proliferation.•Systemic hypoxia-induced cardiac and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in both ventricles with increased width and length of RV myocytes and increased length of LV myocytes•The increase in cardiac myocyte size (myocyte hypertrophy) was sufficient to account for the increase in heart size (cardiac hypertrophy).Diseases that induce cardiomyocyte death can lead to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Since adult cardiomyocytes rarely proliferate, novel therapies that induce adult cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury could replenish myocyte numbers. A previous study23suggested that systemic hypoxemia in adult male mice caused a large increase in ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation. The present study examined the effects of systemic hypoxia on LV and RV myocyte size and proliferation in adult male and female mice. We found that hypoxia caused cardiac hypertrophy in both sexes. However, the numbers of LV and RV myocytes in hypoxia versus normoxia hearts were not different. Both L"

However, cardiac hypertrophy secondary to congenital heart diseases (CHDs) delays this process, thereby decreasing cardiac energetic capacity and function. Cardiac lysine acetylation is involved in modulating fatty acid oxidation. We thus investigated what effect cardiac hypertrophy has on protein acetylation during maturation. Eighty-four right ventricular biopsies were collected from CHD patients and stratified according to age and the absence (n= 44) or presence of hypertrophy (n= 40). A maturational increase in protein acetylation was evident in nonhypertrophied hearts but not in hypertrophied hearts. The fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes, long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (βHAD), were hyperacetylated and their activities positively correlated with their acetylation after birth in nonhypertrophied hearts but not hypertrophied hearts. In line with this, decreased cardiac fatty acid oxidation and reduced acetylation of LCAD and βHAD occurred in newborn rabbits subjected to cardiac hypertrophy due to an aortocaval shunt. Silencing the mRNA of general control of amino acid synthesis 5-like protein 1 reduced acetylation of LCAD and βHAD as well as fatty acid oxidation rates in cardiomyocytes. Thus, hypertrophy in CHDs prevents the postnatal increase in myocardial acetylation, resulting in a delayed maturation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation.Keywords:MetabolismKeywords:Cardiovascular diseaseCardiac hypertrophy in congenital heart diseases prevents the postnatal increase in myocardial acetylation, resulting in a delayed maturation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation.IntroductionCongenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in over 1% of all live births, with one-third of these infants needing surgery within the first month of life (1,2). Despite a remarkable reduction in operative mortality after corrective surgery, heart failure remains a major determinant of outcomes in patients with corrected CHD (3,4).

In HF following cardiac hypertrophy, there is a major metabolic switch in myocardial substrate metabolism from fatty acid to glucose oxidation.2–5A key marker of this switch is the coordinated downregulation of fatty acid oxidation enzymes (eg, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I β) and mRNA levels in the human LV with a concomitant increase in glucose uptake and oxidation.2,6This switch is thought to represent a metabolic reprogramming toward substrate metabolism that is more commonly seen in the fetal heart.7The fetus in a womb uses glucose from the mother as the major substrate for energy production; in fact, ≈80% of fetal energy comes from glucose oxidation.See Article byPanagia et alMoreover, recent studies have suggested that brown adipose tissue (BAT) may play an important role in obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and HF.8–13BAT regulates basal and inducible energy expenditure in humans and is composed of cells that contain numerous lipid droplets, dense packing of mitochondria, and the expression of the mitochondria-associated UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1).11UCP1 mediates the biochemical uncoupling of electron transport by allowing proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, thus short-circuiting the usual linkage of electron transport to adenosine triphosphate production that is catalyzed by ATP synthase.11Instead, the chemical energy generated by cellular respiration in brown adipocytes is dissipated in the form of heat, which allows thermogenesis by mammals in cold environments and newborn humans. Traditionally, BAT was considered to be no longer present and possessed no significant physiological functions in adult humans; however, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging investigations have clearly demonstrated that discreet depots of BAT are still present in human adults.14These studies have relied on the use of clinical PET/CT to correlate focal 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-d-glucose (2-FDG) supraclavicular uptake to tissue fat density rather than solely muscle and termed the finding as uptake in supraclavicular area fat or “USA fat.”In this issue ofCirculation: Cardiovascular Imaging, Panagia et al15aimed to develop a multiplexed optical imaging platform to simultaneously assess the uptake of glucose and fatty acid analogs in multiple organs in a murine model of LV hypertrophy (LVH). They hoped that this approach would leverage the strength of optical imaging to examine multiple processes in various tissues in a simple and high-throughput fashion. In their study, the detection of glucose uptake was measured with 2-FDG via Cerenkov luminescence imaging, a technique that was first used to image tumors in mice but also enabled visualization of the heart.16In addition, the uptake of free fatty acids (FFA) was quantified using a synthetic, long-chain fluorescent FFA (BODIPY FL C16). Both of these imaging agents were injected at the same time intraperitoneally. Simultaneous uptake of these agents was measured in the myocardium, intrascapular BAT, epididymal white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle of the quadriceps in mice with and without thoracic aortic constriction/banding (TAC). Although imaging was performed ex vivo after the animals had been euthanized and the tissues harvested, the authors do show that Cerenkov images of 2-FDG uptake in the mouse heart could be acquired in vivo as well.The authors report that within 5 weeks post-TAC, mice developed LVH and BAT activation with upregulation of β3adrenergic receptors and increased natriuretic peptide receptor ratio. Recent studies have suggested that communication between the heart and BAT is possibly mediated through sympathetic stimulation and cardiac hormones such as natriuretic peptides.8,12,13In addition, there may be reciprocal communication between BAT and the heart.8The heart was shown to be significantly increased in weight at both the 5-week and 15-week time points post-TAC when compared with the controls, whereas there was a significant reduction in BAT weight "

Consistent with this conclusion, we obtained evidence which further suggests that mechanical stimuli utilize PA as a direct upstream activator of mTOR signaling. Unexpectedly though, we found that the activation of PLD is not necessary for the mechanically induced increases in PA or mTOR signaling. Motivated by this observation, we performed experiments that were aimed at identifying the enzyme(s) that promotes the increase in PA. These experiments revealed that mechanical stimulation increases the concentration of diacylglycerol (DAG) and the activity of DAG kinases (DGKs) in membranous structures. Furthermore, using knock-out mice, we determined that the ζ isoform of DGK (DGKζ) is necessary for the mechanically induced increase in PA. We also determined that DGKζ significantly contributes to the mechanical activation of mTOR signaling, and this is likely driven by an enhanced binding of PA to mTOR. Last, we found that the overexpression of DGKζ is sufficient to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy through an mTOR-dependent mechanism, and this event requires DGKζ kinase activity (i.e.the synthesis of PA). Combined, these results indicate that DGKζ, but not PLD, plays an important role in mechanically induced increases in PA and mTOR signaling. Furthermore, this study suggests that DGKζ could be a fundamental component of the mechanism(s) through which mechanical stimuli regulate skeletal muscle mass.IntroductionMechanical stimuli play a critical role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, and the maintenance of muscle mass contributes significantly to heal"

Many reports have documented that the number of nuclei within these cells is also plastic. It has been proposed that a yet-to-be-defined regulatory mechanism functions to maintain a relatively stable relationship between the cytoplasmic volume and nuclear number within the cell, a phenomenon known as the “myonuclear domain” hypothesis. While it is accepted that hypertrophy is typically associated with the addition of new nuclei to the muscle fiber from stem cells such as satellite cells, the loss of myonuclei during atrophy has been controversial. The intersegmental muscles from the tobacco hawkmothManduca sextaare composed of giant syncytial cells that undergo sequential developmental programs of atrophy and programmed cell death at the end of metamorphosis. Since the intersegmental muscles lack satellite cells or regenerative capacity, the tissue is not “contaminated” by these nonmuscle nuclei. Consequently, we monitored muscle mass, cross-sectional area, nuclear number, and cellular DNA content during atrophy and the early phases of cell death. Despite a ∼75–80% decline in muscle mass and cross-sectional area during the period under investigation, there were no reductions in nuclear number or DNA content, and the myonuclear domain was reduced by ∼85%. These data suggest that the myonuclear domain is not an intrinsic property of skeletal muscle and that nuclei persist through atrophy and programmed cell death.skeletal muscleis the largest tissue by mass within the vertebrate body and serves as the organism's primary reservoir of amino acids. Resistance exercise and/or use of anabolic steroids leads to enhanced muscle growth (hypertrophy) and concomitant increases in mass, fiber cross-sectional area, and strength, while starvation, cachexia, or inactivity trigger muscle atrophy and a decline in these same parameters (reviewed in Ref.62).It has long been held that the number of nuclei within a muscle is also plastic, increasing during both early development and hypertrophy to meet the enhanced protein synthetic demands of the larger cell (18,46,61), while decreasing during atrophy to remove surplus nuclei (81). As a result, it has been proposed that the cytoplasmic volume supported by a single nucleus remains relatively constant in muscle (1,32,72). First presented by Strassburger in 1893 (77) as “Wirkungssphäre,” or “sphere of influence,” as a general property of cells, this relationship is more typically referred to as the “myo"

Whilst transgenic mice have been generated for many Hippo genes, the resultant skeletal muscle phenotypes were not always characterized. Here, we aimed to phenotype the hindlimb muscles of Hippo gene-mutatedLats1−/−,Mst2−/−,Vgll3−/−, andVgll4+/−mice. This analysis revealed thatLats1−/−mice have 11% more slow type I fibers than age and sex-matched wild-type controls. Moreover, the mRNA expression of slowMyh7increased by 50%, and the concentration of type I myosin heavy chain is 80% higher inLats1−/−mice than in age and sex-matched wild-type controls. Second, to find out whether exercise-related stimuli affect Lats1, we stimulated C2C12 myotubes with the hypertrophy agent clenbuterol or the energy stress agent AICAR. We found that both stimulatedLats1expression by 1.2 and 1.3 fold respectively. Third, we re-analyzed published datasets and found thatLats1mRNA in muscle is 63% higher in muscular dystrophy, increases by 17–77% after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, by 41–71% in muscles during overload-induced hypertrophy, and by 19–21% after endurance exercise when compared to respective controls. To conclude,Lats1contributes to the regulation of muscle fiber type proportions, and its expression is regulated by physiological and pathological situations in skeletal muscle.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11248-021-00293-4.Keywords:Hippo pathway, Skeletal muscle, Transgenic mice, Lats1, Fiber typeIntroductionWe use our ≈650 human skeletal muscles to move, stand, speak, generate heat, store glucose as glycogen, and amino acids as protein. Skeletal muscles also vary greatly within and in-between individuals. For example, muscle contributes from 20 to 50% to total human body mass (Janssen et al.2000) and this is due to a more than twofold variation of mean fiber cross-sectional areas and fiber numbers (Lexell et al.1988).

Right ventricular hypertrophy was induced by monocrotaline injection, causing pulmonary hypertension. Control (n= 7) and hypertrophied (n= 11) papillary muscles were subjected to sinusoidal length changes at 37°C and 5 Hz with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 15% of the length giving maximum force (Lmax) after being stretched to 92.5% ofLmax. Isometric tension atLmaxwas similar in control and hypertrophied muscles. Work was assessed from the area encompassed by force-length loops. Work per loop was 0.93 ± 0.11 and 0.84 ± 0.11 μJ/mm3(means ± SE) for control and hypertrophied muscles, respectively (P= 0.591). Suprabasal O2uptake per work loop was 5.7 ± 0.7 pmol/mm3in control muscles and 8.7 ± 1.7 pmol/mm3in hypertrophied muscles (P= 0.133). Net mechanical efficiency was calculated from the ratio of work output and suprabasal O2uptake. The efficiency of hypertrophied muscles was 29.1 ± 3.7% and was smaller than in control muscles (43.7 ± 2.2%,P= 0.016). The right ventricular cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area increased from 272 ± 17 μm2in control muscles to 396 ± 31 μm2in hypertrophied muscles (P< 0.003). Mechanical efficiency correlated negatively with right ventricular wall thickness and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area [Spearman rank correlation coefficients of −0.50 (P= 0.039) and −0.53 (P= 0.024), respectively]. We conclude that efficiency decreases with increasing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, the reduced efficiency of diseased whole hearts can be at least partly explained by reduced efficiency at the cardiomyocyte level.patients with chronic heart failurehave reduced myocardial efficiency (3,44,51). Reduced myocardial efficiency in vivo can be due to an increase in afterload, changes in the geometry and activation of the heart, or intrinsic changes in remodeling cardiomyocytes. Molecular studies (21,27–29) have found contractile changes due to a myosin isoform shift from α to β and increase in Ca2+sensitivity in the failing myocardium. Such changes are expected to increase the efficiency of cardiomyocytes during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, which is opposite to the findings in vivo in diseased hearts. It follows that other factors are more important determinants of myocardial efficiency. To elucidate the underlying cause, the mechanical efficiency of"

Rapamycin is considered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and thus, many have concluded that mTOR plays a key role in CML-induced growth. However, direct evidence that mTOR confers the CML-induced activation of growth promoting events such as hypertrophy, hyperplasia and ribosome biogenesis is lacking. This study addressed that gap in knowledge by using a specialized line of transgenic mice. Surprisingly, the results indicate that only a few of the growth promoting events induced by CML are fully dependent on mTOR signalling (e.g. hypertrophy). These results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass and should help future studies aimed at identifying targets for therapies that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during conditions such as bedrest, immobilization, and ageing.AbstractAbstractChronic mechanical loading (CML) of skeletal muscle induces compensatory growth and the drug rapamycin has been reported to block this effect. Since rapamycin is considered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), many have concluded that mTOR plays a key role in CML-induced growth regulatory events. However, rapamycin can exert mTOR-independent actions and systemic administration of rapamycin will inhibit mTOR signalling in all cells throughout the body. Thus, it is not clear if the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin are actually due to the inhibition of mTOR signalling, and more specifically, the inhibition of mTOR signalling in skeletal muscle cells. To address this issue, transgenic mice with muscle specific expression of various rapamycin-resistant mutants of mTOR were employed. These mice enabled us to demonstrate that mTOR, within skeletal muscle cells, is the rapamycin-sensitive element that confers CML-induced hypertrophy, and mTOR kinase activity is necessary for this event. Surprisingly, CML also induced hyperplasia, but this occurred through a rapamycin-insensitive mechanism. Furthermore, CML was found to induce an increase in FoxO1 expression and PKB phosphorylation through a mechanism that was at least partially regulated by an mTOR kinase-dependent mechanism. Finally, CML stimulated ribosomal RNA accumulation and rapamycin partially inhibited this effect; however, the effect of rapamycin was exerted through a mechanism that was independent of mTOR in skeletal muscle cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that CML activates several growth regulatory events, but only a few (e.g. hypertrophy) are fully dependent on mTOR signalling within the skeletal muscle cells.IntroductionSkeletal muscles play a critical role in whole body metab"

Paradoxically, reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines are key for mounting the muscular and systemic adaptive responses to endurance and resistance exercise. Both ageing and lifestyle-related metabolic dysfunction are strongly linked to exercise redox and hypertrophic insensitivity. The adaptive inability and consequent exercise intolerance may discourage people from physical training resulting in a vicious cycle of under-exercising, energy surplus, chronic mitochondrial stress, accelerated functional decline and increased susceptibility to serious diseases. Skeletal muscles are malleable and dynamic organs, rewiring their metabolism depending on the metabolic or mechanical stress resulting in a specific phenotype. Endogenous RNA silencing molecules, microRNAs, are regulators of these metabolic/phenotypic shifts in skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle microRNA profiles at baseline and in response to exercise have been observed to differ between adult and older people, as well as trained vs. sedentary individuals. Likewise, the circulating microRNA blueprint varies based on age and training status. Therefore, microRNAs emerge as key regulators of metabolic health/capacity and hormetic adaptability. In this narrative review, we summarise the literature exploring the links between microRNAs and skeletal muscle, as well as systemic adaptation to exercise. We expand a mathematical model of microRNA burst during adaptation to exercise through supporting data from the literature. We describe a potential link between the microRNA-dependent regulation of redox-signalling sensitivity and the ability to mount a hypertrophic response to exercise or nutritional cues. We propose a hypothetical model of endurance exercise-induced microRNA “memory cloud” responsible for establishing a landscape conducive to aerobic as well as anabolic adaptation. We suggest that regular aerobic exercise, complimented by a healthy diet, in addition to promoting mitochondrial health and hypertrophic/insulin sensitivity, may also suppress the glycolytic phenotype and mTOR signalling through miRNAs which in turn promote systemic metabolic health.Keywords:microRNAs, muscle, redox, sarcopenia, ageing1. Introduction1.1. Challenging the Oxidative Stress Theory of Muscular Function DeclineMaximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) is the maximum volume of oxygen that can be delivered to and consumed by continuously working muscles during a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) [1,2,3]. The main factors contributing to VO2max are the cardiac output, blood volume, haemoglobin concentration-oxygen carrying capacity. These features determine the O2-carrying capacity. At the molecular level, VO2max is dependent on skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and metabolic enzyme capacity, which determine the O2-extracting capacity [4,5]. VO2max is a strong predictor of both endurance exercise performance [3,4] and increased risk of all-cause mortality [6]. Both the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle components of VO2max deteriorate with age [7,8] in addition to reduced or complete cessation in training volume and/or intensity [9]. The f"

Thirteen individuals [24 ± 2 yr (mean ± SD), 9 men] completed two 5-day blocks of 7 BFRRE sessions, separated by a 10-day rest period. Four sets of unilateral knee extensions to voluntary failure at 20% of one repetition maximum (1RM) were conducted with partial blood flow restriction (90–100 mmHg). Muscle samples obtained before, during, 3 days, and 10 days after training were analyzed for muscle fiber area (MFA), myonuclei, SC, and mRNA and miRNA expression. Muscle size was measured by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging and strength with 1RM knee extension. With the first block of BFRRE, SC number increased in both fiber types (70%–80%,P< 0.05), whereas type I and II MFA decreased by 6 ± 7% and 15 ± 11% (P< 0.05), respectively. With the second block of training, muscle size increased by 6%–8%, whereas the number of SCs (type I: 80 ± 63%, type II: 147 ± 95%), myonuclei (type I: 30 ± 24%, type II: 31 ± 28%), and MFA (type I: 19 ± 19%, type II: 11 ± 19%) peaked 10 days after the second block of BFRRE, whereas strength peaked after 20 days of detraining (6 ± 6%,P< 0.05). Pax7- and p21 mRNA expression were elevated during the intervention, whereas myostatin, IGF1R, MyoD, myogenin, cyclinD1 and -D2 mRNA did not change unti"

Twenty-two men with chronic motor complete SCI were randomly assigned to either TRT + RT (n= 11) or TRT (n= 11) for 16 wk. TRT + RT men underwent twice weekly progressive RT using electrical stimulation with ankle weights. TRT was administered via testosterone patches (2–6 mg/day). Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after 16 wk from the right vastus lateralis. Expression of proteins associated with oxidative muscles and mechanical loading (PGC-1α and FAK), muscle hypertrophy (total and phosphorylated Akt, total and phosphorylated mTOR), and cellular metabolism (total and phosphorylated AMPK and GLUT4) were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to measure fiber CSA and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity as well as mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) activity and complex III (CIII) activities. TRT + RT demonstrated a robust 27.5% increase in average fiber CSA compared with a −9% decrease following TRT only (P= 0.01). GLUT4 protein expression was elevated in the TRT + RT group compared with TRT only (P= 0.005). Total Akt (P= 0.06) and phosphorylated Akt Ser389(P= 0.049) were also elevated in the TRT + RT group. Mitochondrial activity of SDH (P= 0.03) and CS (P= 0.006) increased in the TRT + RT group, with no changes in the TRT-only g"

Her medical history included thyroid nodules, but no dental/occlusal disorders were observed. The initial differential diagnosis included salivary gland/jaw bone/masseter pathology, but the CT/MRI revealed only an increase in the size of the masseter and pterygoid muscles. The patient was informed of the benign nature of the swelling and was advised to discontinue the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.ConclusionThe bilateral hypertrophy of masseter muscles should be considered in differential diagnosis in cases of unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid or lateral mandible area.Key Words:Masseter muscles hypertrophy, Bilateral facial swellingIntroductionMasseter muscle hypertrophy (MH) including the pterygoid muscles, also referred as idiopathic or benign masseter hypertrophy is a rare entity of head and neck pathology, and was first described in 1880 in a 10-year-old girl [1]. MH affects both males and females after puberty [2] and is more frequently found in Asians [3].It is important to consider bilateral MH in the differential diagnosis with other pathologic entities including parotid gland tumors or nontumorous diseases (autoimmune, infectious or inflammatory conditions), dental and jaw pathology, muscle tumors and intrinsic masseter muscle myopathy [2,4].Beyond patient information and dental-occlusion improvement, if necessary, surgical intervention may be used for cosmetic reasons and, recently, the use of botulinum toxin type A has been proposed as a preferable therapeutic option [5,6].In this report, simultaneous painless bilateral masseter accompanied by pterygoid muscle hypertrophy is described and the literature is reviewed.Case ReportA 53-year-old female patient was referred for painless swelling of 5 months duration at the parotid and posterior cheek areas bilaterally. There was no history of xerostomia, xerophthalmia or other accompanying general symptoms such as fever and no abnormal laboratory tests. Her medical history included localized osteoarthritis of the right knee, surgically treated 4 years previously, thyroid gland nodules and anxiety. The patient had been on treatment with levothyroxine sodium (for thyroid lesions), statins for control of cholesterol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) including piroxicam and diacerein for 1 year. Due to the improvement of the right knee, the minor gastrointestinal adverse reactions of the NSAIDs and their ineffective action on bilateral facial swelling, the use of these agents was interrupted. In addition to the anti-inflammatory agents, she had undertaken temporal therapy for bilateral facial swelling including antibiotics (azithromycin and clarithromycin) and systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone), also without improvement of the bilateral swelling.Clinical examination of the face showed bilateral swelling located at the parotid-posterior buccal area. The swelling was homogenous, firm and solid in palpation. Skin and oral mucosa of the relevant areas were normal and fix"

However, little knowledge exists on extrinsic factors that influence the content of SCs in skeletal muscle. In a comparative human study, we investigated the muscle fiber type-specific association between emergence of satellite cells (SCs), muscle growth, and remodeling in response to 12 wk unilateral resistance training performed as eccentric (Ecc) or concentric (Conc) resistance training ± whey protein (Whey, 19.5 g protein + 19.5 g glucose) or placebo (Placebo, 39 g glucose) supplementation. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were analyzed for fiber type-specific SCs, myonuclei, and fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Following training, SCs increased with Conc in both type I and type II fibers (P< 0.01) and exhibited a group difference from Ecc (P< 0.05), which did not increase. Myonuclei content in type I fibers increased in all groups (P< 0.01), while a specific accretion of myonuclei in type II fibers was observed in the Whey-Conc (P< 0.01) and Placebo-Ecc (P< 0.01) groups. Similarly, whereas type I fiber CSA increased independently of intervention (P< 0.001), type II fiber CSA increased exclusively with Whey-Conc (P< 0.01) and type II fiber hypertrophy correlated with whole muscle hypertrophy exclusively following Conc training (P< 0.01). In conclusion, isolated concentric knee extensor resistance training appears to constitute a stronger driver of SC content than eccentric resistance training while type II fiber hypertrophy was accentuated when combining concentric resistance training with whey protein supplementation.skeletal muscle maintenanceis essential for preservation of metabolic health and contractile function, and relies on continuous remodeling of muscle tissue initiated through both extrinsic (e.g., physical activity or dietary supplements) and intrinsic (e.g., effects of endogenous molecules released from various tissues/cells) mechanisms. An essential aspect of muscle remodeling and repair is a functional population of quiescent muscle-specific stem cells, commonly referred to as satellite cells (SCs) (7,46,68).

This makes it difficult to establish the relative contribution of each of them to the occurrence of arrhythmias. Accordingly, in this study, we used an in vitro model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH) to investigate its proarrhythmic features and the underlying mechanisms independent of fibrosis or other PCH-related processes. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte (nr-vCMC) monolayers were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to create an in vitro model of PCH. The electrophysiological properties of PMA-treated and control monolayers were analyzed by optical mapping atday 9of culture. PMA treatment led to a significant increase in cell size and total protein content. It also caused a reduction in sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase 2 level (32%) and an increase in natriuretic peptide A (42%) and α1-skeletal muscle actin (34%) levels, indicating that the hypertrophic response induced by PMA was, indeed, pathological in nature. PMA-treated monolayers showed increases in action potential duration (APD) and APD dispersion, and a decrease in conduction velocity (CV; APD30of 306 ± 39 vs. 148 ± 18 ms, APD30dispersion of 85 ± 19 vs. 22 ± 7 and CV of 10 ± 4 vs. 21 ± 2 cm/s in controls). Upon local 1-Hz stimulation, 53.6% of the PMA-treated cultures showed focal tachyarrhythmias based on triggered activity (n= 82), while the control group showed 4.3% tachyarrhythmias (n= 70). PMA-treated nr-vCMC cultures may, thus, represent a well-controllable in vitro model for testing new therapeutic interventions targeting specific aspects of hypertrophy-associated arrhythmias.NEW & NOTEWORTHYPhorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (nr-vCMCs) led to induction of many significant features of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH), including action potential duration prolongation and dispersion, which provided enough time and depolarizing force for formation of early afterdepolarization (EAD)-induced focal tachyarrhythmias. PMA-treated nr-vCMCs represent a well-controllable in vitro model, which mostly resembles to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) rather than severe LVH, in which generation of a reentry is the putative mechanism of its arrhythmias.INTRODUCTIONAn increase in cardiac demand triggers the heart to respond in several ways, including by the enlargement o"

The 3D-EM was composed of C2C12 cells and type 1 collagen gel, was differentiated for 14 days, and was divided into four groups: control, maca, EPS, and maca + EPS. The medium was replaced every two days before each EPS intervention, and the concentration of maca in the culture solution was 1 mg/mL. The intervention conditions of the EPS were 30 V, 1 Hz, and 2 ms (24 h on, 24 h off, for one week). The expression levels of proteins were examined by Western blotting. The intervention of maca and EPS upregulated the expression of MHC-fast/slow (bothp< 0.05) compared with the control group, and the addition of maca had no effect on the phosphorylation of mTOR (p= 0.287) but increased the AMPK phosphorylation (p= 0.001). These findings suggest that intervention with maca and EPS has a positive effect on muscle hypertrophy, which has a positive impact on sarcopenia. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further explored.Keywords:3D-EM, maca, EPS, hypertrophy, sarcopenia1. IntroductionSarcopenia is a geriatric muscle disease characterized by low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance, and it also leads to disabilities and an increased risk of death [1]. In addition to aging, disease, a sedentary lifestyle, energy deficiency, and poor protein intake can also lead to an increased incidence of sarcopenia [2,3]. However, resistance exercise and nutrition are known to counteract muscle wasting [4,5].Regarding nutrition, numerous plant-derived natural compounds have demonstrated their "

Better understanding of the cardiac metabolic phenotype and metabolic signaling could help identify the role metabolic remodeling plays within HF and the conditions known to transition toward HF, including “pathological” hypertrophy. In this review, we discuss metabolic phenotype and metabolic signaling in the contexts of pathological hypertrophy and HF. We discuss the significance of alterations in energy supply (substrate utilization, oxidative capacity, and phosphotransfer) and energy sensing using observations from human and animal disease models and models of manipulated energy supply/sensing. We aim to provide ways of thinking about metabolic remodeling that center around metabolic flexibility, capacity (reserve), and efficiency rather than around particular substrate preferences or transcriptomic profiles. We show that maladaptive metabolic remodeling takes multiple forms across multiple energy-handling domains. We suggest that lack of metabolic flexibility and reserve (substrate, oxidative, and phosphotransfer) represents a final common denominator ultimately compromising efficiency and contractile reserve in stressful contexts.normal cardiomyocyte metabolismrequires the transfer of energy from chemical bonds in substrate fuels to ATP and then from ATP to the molecular engines that perform cardiac work (energy supply and transduction). Underpinning these processes are mechanisms to maintain energy homeostasis by matching ATP demand with supply (energy sensing).Alterations in cardiac metabolism are observed in cardiac hypertrophy, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure (HF) and are understood to contribute to poor prognosis. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help explain the metabolic contribution toward these diseases, the incomplete rescue observed with current therapies, and the rationale for potential future energy-targeted therapies.The Cardiac Metabolic Phenotype in the Normal HeartEnergy supply.Energy supply is divided into three stages [Fig. 1,A–D(first stage),EandF(second stage), andG(third stage)]. The first stage encompasses substrate delivery, selection, uptake and oxidation, and the generation of acetyl-CoA and its entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via citrate synthase. The greatest contributors to acetyl-CoA formation are nonesterified long-chain fatty acids (FAs; 60–90%) and "

Localized swelling of the forearm due to hypertrophy of the palmaris longus muscle is rare.Case presentationHere, we report a rare case of a 24-year-old Arab man who presented with a painful mass on his forearm with symptoms of median nerve compression. A full radiological assessment was performed, and he was treated conservatively.ConclusionThis case confirmed that a hypertrophied palmaris longus muscle can be the cause of swelling on the forearm and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. With this report, we aimed to increase awareness regarding the unusual variations of palmaris longus muscle and the importance of using radiological investigations to establish a diagnosis.Keywords:Palmaris longus, Muscle hypertrophy, Muscle anomaly, Muscle variant, Magnetic resonance image, Median nerve compressionIntroductionSwelling on the forearm is usually because of a trauma, such as fracture, tendonitis, or muscle tear. It could also be due to inflammatory conditions like cellulitis, abscess, osteomyelitis, or phlebitis. Non-traumatic causes of swelling on the forearm are generally uncommon. Recently, several authors have described different variations in the morphology, agenesis, and location of the palmaris longus muscle (PLM) [1–3]. Localized swelling of the forearm due to hypertrophy of the PLM is very rare [4–7]. As it is unusual to see such cases, diagnosing hypertrophy of the PLM as the cause of a swelling can be difficult and confusing.Here we report a rare case of an unusual variation of the PLM that presented as a painful swelling on the distal forearm. In this case, a radiological approach was used to diagnose the cause of the swelling. This approach was effective for this case and can help diagnose similar cases in the future.Case presentationA 24-year-old right-handed Arab man, working as a computer engineer, presented with a painful mass on his right wrist that had appeared 2 years ago. The mass had slowly grown over the past 2 years and the pain had "

The Gundersen laboratory introduced the concept of myonuclear number conferring muscle memory in 2010 based on work in rodents that underwent synergist ablation overload followed by denervation (1), which has received considerable attention, extending to the lay press (3a). In brief, it is thought that myonuclei acquired from satellite cell fusion during hypertrophic growth remain after detraining when the muscle returns to its pretraining state. If one were to retrain, the need to acquire new myonuclei during hypertrophy would already be met by the previous training stimulus, and growth would proceed more rapidly. The previously acquired myonuclei would serve as a “muscle memory” of prior adaptation.Psilander et al. (12) put forth a tremendous effort to determine whether muscle memory is mediated by myonuclear number, and should be commended for attempting to translate their results from rodent models to humans. Too often, researchers stop short of trying to validate a mechanism in humans, and more work such as this must be undertaken to fully understand skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise. In brief, their study design involved evaluating myonuclear density and muscle size before resistance training, after 10 wk of combined conventional and blood flow-restricted unilateral resistance training that was (according to the authors) specifically designed to elicit myonuclear addition, following 20 wk of detraining, and then again following a short final 5 wk of bilateral training. The contralateral leg served as a control and only underwent the short final training to evaluate the presence of “muscle memory.” The main take-home messages from their manuscript wer"

Our objective was to examine the validity of panoramic ultrasound to detect change in quadriceps and gastrocnemius size in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects randomized to 70 days of bed rest (BR) with or without exercise.MethodsPanoramic ultrasound and MRI images of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were acquired on the right leg of 27 subjects (26 male, 1 female; age: 34.6 ± 7.8 years; body mass: 77.5 ± 10.0 kg; body mass index: 24.2 ± 2.8 kg/m2; height: 179.1 ± 6.9 cm) before (BR‐6), during (BR3, 7, 11, 15, 22, 29, 36, 53, 69), and after (BR+3, +6, +10) BR. Validity of panoramic ultrasound to detect change in muscle CSA was assessed by Bland–Altman plots, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.ResultsSix hundred ninety‐eight panoramic ultrasound CSA and 698 MRI CSA measurements were assessed. Concordance between ultrasound and MRI was excellent in the quadriceps (CCC: 0.78;P< 0.0001), whereas there was poor concordance in the gastrocnemius (CCC: 0.37;P< 0.0006). Compared with MRI, panoramic ultrasound demonstrated high accuracy in detecting quadriceps atrophy and hypertrophy (sensitivity: 73.7%; specificity: 74.2%) and gastrocnemius atrophy (sensitivity: 83.1%) and low accuracy in detecting gastrocnemius hypertrophy (specificity: 33.0%).ConclusionsPanoramic ultrasound imaging is a valid tool for monitoring quadriceps muscle atrophy and hypertrophy and for detecting gastrocnemius atrophy.Keywords:Panoramic ultrasound, Magnetic resonance imaging, Hypertrophy, Atrophy, DisuseIntroductionMuscle mass loss affects patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and millions of apparently healthy adults over the age of 70.1,2,3,4,5,6,7Moreover, muscle atrophy can develop independent of disease and aging through immobilization and reduced physical activity.8Assessment of muscle cross‐sectional area (CSA) is used clinically to assess lean tissue mass9and has been shown to independently predict survival, the risk of treatment failure, hospital re‐admission, and cancer therapy‐induced toxicity.2,3,10Importantly, recent findings suggest that skeletal muscle measurements assessing change in muscle size over time may improve prognostication over a single time point assessment.11,12,13The strong association between reduced muscle size and morbidity and"

Toxin-induced muscle injury to tibialis anterior muscles of wild-type mice caused ICAM-1 to be expressed by a population of satellite cells/myoblasts and myofibers. Myogenic cell expression of ICAM-1 contributed to the restoration of muscle structure after injury, as regenerating myofibers were more abundant and myofiber size was larger for wild-type compared withIcam1−/−mice during 28 days of recovery. Contrastingly, restoration of muscle function after injury was similar between the genotypes. ICAM-1 facilitated the restoration of muscle structure after injury through mechanisms involving the regulation of myofiber branching, protein synthesis, and the organization of nuclei within myofibers after myogenic cell fusion. These findings provide support for a paradigm in which ICAM-1 expressed by myogenic cells after muscle injury augments their adhesive and fusogenic properties, which, in turn, facilitates regenerative and hypertrophic processes that restore structure to injured muscle.Skeletal muscle injury, resulting from physical activity or trauma, elicits a local inflammatory response, which contributes to the resolution of the injury by promoting processes of muscle regeneration.1,2,3,4Indeed, components of the inflammatory response, such as macrophages, cytokines, and adhesion molecules, facilitate regenerative and hypertrophic processes within skeletal muscle by promoting proliferation of muscle precursor cells called satellite cells/myoblasts,4as well as the formation and hypertrophy of myofibers.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15The release of cytokines (eg, insulin-like growth factor 1 and IL-6) and other molecules (eg, nitric oxide and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1) from macrophages serves as mechanisms through which they promote satellite cell/myoblast proliferation after injury.6,9,11,12,15Little, however, is known about how the local inflammatory response regulates processes of muscle regeneration that are downstream of satellite cell/myoblast proliferation, such as homotypic adhesion and subsequent fusion of myogenic cells and protein synthesis, which are essential processes in the formation and hypertrophy of myofibers after injury.16,17We have investigated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54), which mediates cell-to-cell adhesion and communication during an inflammatory response,18,19as a mechanism through which the inflammatory response facilitates regenerative and hypertrophic processes within skeletal muscle.13,20,21,22Endothelial cells and leukocytes constitutively express ICAM-1 at low levels, and other cell types (eg, myogenic cells) express ICAM-1 afterin vitroexposure to "

The Journal of Physiology © 2017 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC5451728 PMID:28370225Skeletal muscle homeostasis is a balance between muscle hypertrophy, atrophy and regeneration. During ageing and cachexia, this balance is disrupted. Age‐related loss of muscle mass and function is associated with frailty and an increase in co‐mortalities and co‐morbidities. Age‐related muscle wasting is of particular importance in our ageing society, with significant impact on the quality of life of older people and healthcare costs. As muscle hypertrophy is often associated with increased muscle force, exercise training is used to stimulate muscle hypertrophy and strength, and therefore enhance performance and to improve quality of life. However, exercise interventions designed to improve muscle function in older subjects aim to improve the function of the residual muscle fibres but do not address the mechanistic changes occurring during age‐related muscle loss.Sirtuins are a conserved family of NAD+‐dependent deacetylases involved in the control of muscle homeostasis and the ageing process. A member of this family, SIRT‐1, has been reported to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, atrophy and myogenesis in skeletal muscle. SIRT‐1 resides mostly in the nucleus, where it acts as a functional transcriptional repressor through histone deacetylation but can also directly regulate target proteins by deacetylation. Interest in SIRT‐1 begun a decade ago, when activators of SIRT‐1 were shown to extend the lifespan (Gomeset al.2013). Since then, the beneficial role of SIRT‐1 in regulating skeletal muscle mass and satellite cell metabolism, proliferation and differentiation have been demonstrated by many authors. Moreover, SIRT‐1 has been proposed as part of the mechanisms associated with loss of muscle mass and function during ageing (Donghoon & Goldberg,2013; Gomeset al.2013).A paper by Koltaiet al. in this issue ofThe Journal of Physiologyadds a new layer of information to the potential involvement of SIRT‐1 in regulating muscle homeostasis by controlling muscle hypertrophy (Koltaiet al.2017). The authors demonstrate that overload‐induced hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle is accompanied by an increase in SIRT‐1 expression and SIRT‐1 activity. SIRT‐1‐mediated regulation of muscle hypertrophy/atrophy has been previously suggested (Gomeset al.2013); however, the downstream mechanisms of SIRT‐1 regulation of muscle homeostasis are only partially understood. Koltaiet al. propose a direct role of SIRT‐1 in compensatory hypertrophy of skeletal muscle. The authors show that the changes in SIRT‐1 levels and activity during muscle hypertrophy are accompanied by an increase in AKT levels, which regulates protein synthesis, and a decrease in FOXO1, which regulates protein degradation. The authors also suggest that SIRT‐1 may contribute to muscle hypertrophy via regulating satellite cell function, which is in agreement with data showing regulation of satellite cell metabolism via SIRT‐1‐mediated control of autophagy (Tang & Rando,2014). Furthermore, changes in SIRT‐1 expression during plantaris hypertrophy were associated with an increase in target protein endothelial nitric oxide synthase, but an overall decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a signalling role for low levels of ROS in regulating the balance between muscle hypertrophy and atrophy.The authors further investigate epigenetic mechanisms that may regulate SIRT‐1 expression in muscle during hypertrophy, focusing on small non‐coding RNAs, microRNAs: emerging potent regulators of muscle homeostasis. The authors demonstrate that changes in SIRT‐1 expression are concomitant with downregulation of miR‐133 and miR‐1 expression. This is in agreement with previously suggested roles of miR‐133a and miR‐1 in the inhibition of muscle hypertrophy. Changes in other microRNAs: miR‐23a, miR‐34a, miR‐125b and miR‐214, previously reported to regulate muscle atrophy, hypertrophy and/or regeneration, were also measured.The expression of SIRT‐1 has been previously shown to be controlled by microRNAs (Sorianoet al"

In the present study, miR-327 levels in fibroblasts were increased in response to cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction with prominent cardiac fibrosis, particularly when compared with the levels in unstressed cardiomyocytes. In neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, induced expression of miR-327 upregulated fibrosis-associated gene expression and activated angiotensin II-induced differentiation into myofibroblasts, as assessed via α-smooth muscle actin staining. By contrast, miR-327 knockdown mitigated angiotensin II-induced differentiation. Cardiac fibroblast proliferation was not affected under either condition. In a mouse model subjected to transverse aortic constriction, miR-327 knockdown through tail-vein injection reduced the development of cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction. miR-327 was demonstrated to target integrin β3 and diminish the activation of cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, the present study supports the use of miR-327 as a therapeutic target in the reduction of cardiac fibrosis.Keywords:microRNA-327, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, integrin β3IntroductionMechanical and chemical stimuli, including changes in pressure and changes in the levels of cytokines, hormones or growth factors, trigger cardiac hypertrophy, which subsequently leads to cardiomyopathy and heart failure (1,2). Despite improvements in treatment strategies and the current understanding of the pathology, heart failure continues to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Pathological hypertrophy, as well as other types of cardiac injury, may trigger cardiac fibrosis, which in turn leads to adverse ventricular remodeling and heart failure (3–5). Therefore, identifying therapeutics that prevent the onset of pathological cardiac hypertrophy is of great interest.Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs/"

Thus, regenerative myoblasts/satellite cells are exposed to different levels and durations of partial oxygen pressure depending on the spatial distance from the blood vessels. To date, it is unclear how hypoxia affects myoblasts proliferation, differentiation, and particularly fusion with normoxic myoblasts. To study this, we investigated how 21% and 2% oxygen affects C2C12 myoblast morphology, proliferation, and myogenic differentiation and evaluated the fusion of normoxic- or hypoxic-preconditioned C2C12 cells in 21% or 2% oxygen in vitro. Out data show that the long-term hypoxic culture condition does not affect the proliferation of C2C12 cells but leads to rounder cells and reduced myotube formation when compared with myoblasts exposed to normoxia. However, when normoxic- and hypoxic-preconditioned myoblasts were differentiated together, the resultant myotubes were significantly larger than the control myotubes. Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed several novel candidate genes that are differentially regulated during the differentiation under normoxia and hypoxia in mixed culture conditions and may thus be involved in the increase in myotube size. Taken together, oxygen-dependent adaption and interaction of myoblasts may represent a novel approach for the development of innovative therapeutic "

Alterations in the force-frequency relationship are commonly used as markers for heart failure with a negative staircase being a hallmark of decompensated cardiac function. Here we aim to determine the functional and molecular alterations in the very early stages of compensatory hypertrophy through analysis of the force-frequency relationship, using a novel isolated muscle culture system that allows assessment of force-frequency relationship during the development of hypertrophy. New Zealand white male rabbit trabeculae excised from the right ventricular free wall were utilized for all experiments. Briefly, muscles held at constant preload and contracting isometrically were stimulated to contract in culture for 24 h, and in a subset up to 48 h. We found that, upon an increase in the preload and maintaining the muscles in culture for up to 24 h, there was an increase in baseline force produced by isolated trabeculae over time. This suggests a gradual compensatory response to the impact of increased preload. Temporal analysis of the force-frequency response during this progression revealed a significant blunting (at 12 h) and then reversal of the positive staircase as culture time increased (at 24 h). Phosphorylation analysis revealed a significant decrease in desmin and troponin (Tn)I phosphorylation from 12 to 24 h in culture. These results show that even very early on in the compensatory hypertrophy state, the force-frequency relationship is already affected. This effect on force-frequency relationship may, in addition to protein expression changes, be partially attributed to the alterations in myofilament protein phosphorylation.heart disease is the number onekiller in the western world, emphasizing the need for understanding the progression to failure and the development of different treatment strategies. There are numerous causes of heart failure, but a rather common denominator is the presence of some type of hypertrophic maladaptive growth of the myocardium. Cardiac hypertrophy is, most generally, caused by an increase in cardiac load, induced by elevated blood pressure (5,31,38). Normally, hypertrophy occurs as a compensatory mechanism to ameliorate the immediate effects of hypertension. This increased load, ultimately, leads to a deficiency in pump function of the heart. If this deficiency chronically remains, a hypertrophic response occurs, which is almost always irreversible.Hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in the size of the cardiomyocyte, through the addition "

He had hypertrophy of calf muscles and the thyroid profile showed low levels of T3, T4 and markedly elevated level of thyroid-stimulating hormone thus confirming the presence of hypothyroidism. This combination of hypothyroidism and hypertrophy of muscles is classically described as Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome. This child was started on 50 µg of levothyroxine.BackgroundThough it is a rare condition, the combination of features of hypothyroidism and calf muscle hypertrophy make it very easy to pick it up.Thyroid hormone deficiency is a rare cause of acquired myopathy, comprising only 5% of the total cases.This hypertrophy is reversible with treatment. Patients usually take months to recover, our patient, on first follow-up at 2 weeks showed clinical reduction in the bulk of muscle which was also observed by the parents.Case presentationA 4-year-male child, born of non-consanguineous marriage was brought to us with history of growth failure and developmental delay. The parents took notice of the growth and developmental delay only in last 6 months. They were seeking advice in their village.There was no history of frequent loose stools, urination or any febrile illness. The antenatal and birth history were unremarkable. There was no history of similar problems in the two siblings. The mother did not have any problem.This child had coarse features, depressed nose bridge and a large tongue (figure 1).Figure 1.Open in a new tabCoarse facies, large tongue, depressed nose bridge.He weighed 10 kg, his height was 74 cm and head circumference 47 cm (all below third percentile). His height age corresponded to that of an year-old child's. His upper body segment was 44 cm and the lower segment was 30 cm, with an upper and lower segment ratio of almost 1.5 (figure 2).Figure 2.Open in a new tabShort stature, calf muscle hypertrophy.His developmental assessment showed normal gross motor milestones. He was able to draw a circle, but could not draw a square, he made a tower of six cubes and he spoke only monosyllables and could not speak sentences.He showed hypertrophy of both the calf muscles. Gower sign was negative.Rest of the examination was unremarkable.InvestigationsComplete blood count revealed haemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume was 90. Electrolytes, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), chest x-ray were normal.T3<10 ng/dl (60–200), T4 0.7 µg/dl (4.5–12.0), thyroid-stimulating hormone >150 mIU/ml (0.30–5.5). Bone age: 6 months (figure 3).Figure 3.Open in a new tabBone age 6 months.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis for a child with the macroglossia, developmental delay and coarse features would include a mucopolysaccharidosis, Beckwith–Wiedemann or Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome. All these could easily be differentiated on clinical grounds.A combination of macroglossia, developmental delay, stunting and pseudohypertrophy of muscles clinches the diagnosis of Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome (KDS).Muscle enlargement, stiffness and cramping are a constellation of findings seen in individuals with hypothyroidism. In adults, these findings are known as Hoffman syndrome, The absence of painful spasms and pseudomyotonia differentiates this syndrome from KDS.TreatmentThis child was started on 50 µg of levothyroxine daily.Outcome and follow-upThe child came for the first follow-up 2 weeks after the start of treatment and his calf hypertrophy had reduced and he was more active and interactive.DiscussionThe KDS is a myopathy of hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by muscular hypertrophy limited to lower extremity or being generalised, short stature and cretinism. Children with KDS usually present between 18 months and 10 years of age, but reports of cases diagnosed at earlier ages and even in neonates are also available.1Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome comprised 18.7% of cases with a 2:1 female to male ratio.2The patients present with the clinical features of hypothyroidism along with muscle pseudohypertrophy.3The pseudohypertrophy involves muscles of extremities, limb girdle, trunk, hands and feet but it is more prominent in muscles of limbs; he"

Twelve untrained males (age: 20 ± 1 yr, BMI: 26.9 ± 5.4 kg/m2;n= 12) engaged in a 10-wk resistance training program (2×/week) where right midthigh images and VL biopsies were obtained before and 72 h following the last training bout. Participants’ VL mCSAMRI(P= 0.005), DXA thigh lean mass (P= 0.015), and VLThick(P= 0.001) increased following training, whereas VL mCSAUSand fCSA did not. ForAim1, mCSAUSdemonstrated excellent concordance [concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) = 0.830] with mCSAMRI, albeit mCSAUSvalues were systematically lower compared with mCSAMRI(mean bias: −2.29 cm2). In addition, PRE-to-POST VL mCSA changes between techniques exhibited good agreement (CCC = 0.700; mean bias: −1.08 cm2). ForAim2, moderate, positive correlations existed for pre-to-post changes in VL mCSAMRIand DXA thigh lean mass (r= 0.580,P= 0.048), mCSAUS(r= 0.622,P= 0.0"

Accordingly, it has been suggested that regression of cardiac hypertrophy associated with renin-Ang system blockade is due to inhibition of cellular actions of Ang II in the heart, above and beyond their effects to reduce pressure overload. We generated 2 distinct mouse lines with cell-specific deletion of AT1Areceptors, from cardiomyocytes. In the first line (C-SMKO), elimination of AT1Areceptors was achieved using a heterologousCre recombinasetransgene under control of theSm22promoter, which expresses in cells of smooth muscle lineage including cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells of conduit but not resistance vessels. The second line (R-SMKO) utilized aCretransgene knocked-in to theSm22locus, which drives expression in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in both conduit and resistance arteries. Thus, although both groups lack AT1receptors in the cardiomyocytes, they are distinguished by presence (C-SMKO) or absence (R-SMKO) of peripheral vascular responses to Ang II. Similar to wild-types, chronic Ang II infusion caused hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in C-SMKO mice, whereas both hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were reduced in R-SMKOs. Thus, despite the absence of AT1Areceptors in cardiomyocytes, C-SMKOs develop robust cardiac hypertrophy. By contrast, R-SMKOs developed identical levels of hypertrophy in response to pressure overload–induced by transverse aortic banding. Our findings suggest that direct activation of AT1receptors in cardiac myocytes has minimal influence on cardiac hypertrophy induced by renin-Ang system activation or pressure overload.IntroductionHypertension is a major public health problem causing significant risk of end-organ damage including stroke and cardiovascular disease.1Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a frequent complication of chronic hypertension, increasing risk for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality.2The renin-Ang (angiotensin) system (RAS) plays a prominent role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and hypertension pathogenesis.3Components of the RAS are expressed in organ systems and cell lineages contributing to BP regulation. In addition to its effects to cause hypertension, Ang receptors may directly promote end-organ damage in target tissues. In this regard, it has been suggested that actions of Ang II mediated by its receptors in the kidney, heart, and central nervous system may contribute to morbidity and mortality above and beyond increases BP.The classical effects of the RAS are mediated by Ang II acting via AT1(type 1 angiotensin) receptors. This activation triggers a cascade of classic physiological responses, including vasoconstriction, activation of sympathetic nervous system, and stimulation of sodium reabsorption by the kidney, which all contribute to elevated BP in hypertension.4AT1receptor blockers and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are effective and widely used antihypertensive agents.5RAS blockade using Ang receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors are not only effective at lowering BP but also attenuating end-organ damage, such as reducing LVH, and decreasing cardiovascular mortality.6,7The clinical evidence indicating a key contribution of RAS activation to development of LVH in hypertension is clear-cut.8–10However, the mechanism of this effect is potentially complex as AT1receptor activation triggers an array of cellular, vascular, and neuroendocrine responses that each might distinctly promote the development of hypertrophy. For example, activation of AT1receptors triggers signaling pathways that have been linked to LVH,11and indeed, Ang II induces hypertrophy of cultured cardiac myocytes.12,13Furthermore, models of forced overexpression of wild-type (WT) and constitutively activated AT1receptors in cardiomyocytes have consistently been shown to induce hypertrophy in vivo.14,15In contrast, several studies using mice completely deficient in AT1Arecepto"

Whether suppressing myostatin could benefit pressure-overloaded heart remains unclear. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of myostatin on cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in a mouse model of pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Two weeks after the surgery, TAC and sham mice were randomly divided into groups receiving mRK35, a monoclonal anti-myostatin antibody, or vehicle (PBS) for 8 wk. Significant progressive cardiac hypertrophy was observed in TAC mice, as reflected by the increased wall thickness, ventricular weight, and cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes. In the groups treated with mRK35, compared with sham mice, cardiac fibrosis was increased in TAC mice, accompanied with elevated mRNA expression of fibrotic genes. However, among the TAC mice, mRK35 did not reduce cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. Body weight, lean mass, and wet weights of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle bundle were increased by mRK35. When compared with the TAC-PBS group, the TAC mice treated with mRK35 demonstrated greater forelimb grip strength and a larger mean size of gastrocnemius fibers. Our data suggest that mRK35 does not attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a TAC mouse model but has positive effects on muscle mass and muscle strength. Anti-myostatin treatment may have therapeutic value against muscle wasting in cardiac vascular disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHYRecent research has highlighted the importance of inhibiting TGF-β signaling in mitigating cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. As myostatin belongs to the TGF-β family, we evaluated the impact of myostatin inhibition using mRK35 in TAC-operated mice. Our data demonstrate that mRK35 significantly increased body weight, muscle mass, and muscle strength but did not attenuate cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. Pharmacological inhibition of myostatin may provide therapeutic benefits for "

We tested the hypothesis that chronic restoration ofmiR‐1gene expression in vivo will regress hypertrophy and protect against adverse cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload.Methods and ResultsCardiac hypertrophy was induced by left ventricular pressure overload in maleSprague‐Dawley rats subjected to ascending aortic stenosis. When the hypertrophy was established at 2 weeks after surgery, the animals were randomized to receive either an adeno‐associated virus expressingmiR‐1(AAV9.miR‐1) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as control (AAV9.GFP) via a single‐bolus tail‐vein injection. Administration ofmiR‐1regressed cardiac hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness,; 2.32±0.08 versus 2.75±0.07 mm,P<0.001) and (left ventricular septum wall thickness, 2.23±0.06 versus 2.54±0.10 mm,P<0.05) and halted the disease progression compared with control‐treated animals, as assessed by echocardiography (fractional shortening, 37.60±5.01% versus 70.68±2.93%,P<0.05) and hemodynamic analyses (end‐systolic pressure volume relationship/effective arterial elastance, 1.87±0.46 versus 0.96±0.38,P<0.05) after 7 weeks of treatment. Additionally,miR‐1replacement therapy lead to a marked reduction of myocardial fibrosis, an improvement in calcium handling, inhibition of apoptosis, and inactivation of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling pathways, suggesting a favorable effect on preventing the maladaptive ventricular remodeling. We also identified and validated a novel bona fide target ofmiR‐1, Fibullin‐2 (Fbln2), a secreted protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling.ConclusionsTaken together, our findings suggest that restoration ofmiR‐1gene expression is a potential novel therapeutic strategy to reverse pressure‐induced cardiac hypertrophy and prevent maladaptive cardiac remodeling.IntroductionCardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive growth response of the heart in response to increased stress such as aortic stenosis. Persistent stress activates diverse signal transduction pathways leading to pathological remodeling of the heart and consequently the development of heart failure, a syndrome characterized by dilatation of the left ventricle and contractile dysfunction.1,2,3Cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure, and its therapeutic reversal is associated with improved mortality.4,5Recent studies have indicated a key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in biological processes including differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and development,6,7and their dysregulation has been linked to several human diseases,7including cardiovascular disease.8,9miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that act as post‐transcriptional repressors of target genes by antisense binding to 3′‐untranslated regions (3′‐UTRs) of target mRNAs, resulting in mRNA degradation and/or translational repression.10Their altered expression has been linked to heart disease, and several miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the diseased heart, suggesting that altered miRNA gene expression may be a common feature of human cardiovascular disease.11,12,13,14,15,16,17Previous studies have shown that the muscle‐specificmiR‐1is a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, and its expression is diminished in both animal models and human heart disease.11,12,17,18,19Because individual miRNAs often regulate the expression of multiple gene targets, modulating the expression of a single miRNA can, in principle, influence multiple gene networks and thereby modify complex disease phenotypes. The network ofmiR‐1target genes and their mechanism of action in the heart have led to the suggestion thatmiR‐1gene replacement may provide a potential source of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities in humans.In this study, we addressed a clinically relevant question of whether the chronic restoration ofmiR‐1expression in vivo by adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐mediated gene transfer could be protective against the maladaptive cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload. We present evidence that the restoration ofmiR‐1gene expre"

Previously untrained men and women (men: 29 ± 9 yr and women: 29 ± 2 yr,n= 7 each) completed 6 wk of very low-volume high-intensity sprint interval training. In a separate study, recreationally active men (n= 16) and women (n= 3) completed 6 wk of either traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise (n= 9, 21 ± 4 yr) or low-volume sprint interval training (n= 10, 21 ± 2 yr). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis before and after training. The fiber type-specific SC response to training was determined, as was the activity of the SC pool using immunofluorescent microscopy of muscle cross sections. Training did not induce hypertrophy, as assessed by muscle cross-sectional area, nor did the SC pool expand in any group. However, there was an increase in the number of active SCs after each intervention. Specifically, the number of activated (Pax7+/MyoD+,P≤ 0.05) and differentiating (Pax7−/MyoD+,P≤ 0.05) SCs increased after each training intervention. Here, we report evidence of activated and cycling SCs that may or may not contribute to exercise-induced adaptations while the SC pool remains constant after three nonhypertrophic exercise training protocols.skeletal muscle repairis largely possible due to a pool of resident muscle stem cells, referred to as satellite cells (SCs) (31). Although essential in mediating skeletal muscle regeneration (24,30,32,41,49), SCs become active after various stresses, such as eccentrically loaded muscle contractions (8,10,33,38,42) and bouts of resistan"

However, the role ofCTMPin pathological cardiac hypertrophy has not been identified.Methods and ResultsIn this study, decreased expression ofCTMPwas observed in both human failing hearts and murine hypertrophied hearts. To further explore the potential involvement ofCTMPin pathological cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac‐specificCTMPknockout and overexpression mice were generated. In vivo experiments revealed thatCTMPdeficiency exacerbated the cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and function induced by pressure overload, whereasCTMPoverexpression alleviated the response to hypertrophic stimuli. Consistent with the in vivo results, adenovirus‐mediated gain‐of‐function or loss‐of‐function experiments showed thatCTMPalso exerted a protective effect against hypertrophic responses to angiotensinIIin vitro. Mechanistically,CTMPameliorated pathological cardiac hypertrophy through the blockade of the protein kinase B signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase B activation withLY294002 rescued the deteriorated effect in aortic banding–treated cardiac‐specificCTMPknockout mice.ConclusionsTaken together, these findings imply, for the first time, that increasing the cardiac expression ofCTMPmay be a novel therapeutic strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?•The expression of carboxyl‐terminal modulator protein is decreased in human failing hearts, murine hypertrophied hearts, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with angiotensin II.•Carboxyl‐terminal modulator protein is a negative regulator of pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in vivo and in vitro.•Carboxyl‐terminal modulator protein exerts its antihypertrophic effect by inhibiting the protein kinase B signaling pathway.What Are the Clinical Implications?•These findings elaborate a new mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, which indicates that increasing the cardiac expression of carboxyl‐terminal modulator protein may be a novel therapeutic strategy for this disease.•This study is instructive for cardiologists and other related physicians to understand the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.IntroductionPathological cardiac hypertrophy is initially an adaptive response of the heart to a variety of common cardiovascular stresses, such as uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and valvular stenosis.1However, prolonged stimulation induces a shift from compensated hypertrophy to decompensated hypertrophy, which directly leads to cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, and even sudden death.2Thus, pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a crucial predisposing factor for cardiovascular events and is the leading cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality globally.3Multiple signaling pathways, including the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, and the protein kinase C pathway, have been identified in the initiation and development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.5Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these pathways remain incompletely understood. A better understanding of these mechanisms should shed light on novel therapeutic targets for ameliorating pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Carboxyl‐terminal modulator protein (CTMP), also known as thioesterase superfamily member 4, contains 2 functional domains, including a C‐terminal thioesterase domain and a conserved mitochondrial‐related N‐terminal domain.8CTMP is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart.10As a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein, CTMP is synthesized and translocated by mitochondrial localization signals.11On cell death stimulation, CTMP is released to the cytosol and makes cells sensitive to apoptosis.11Meanwhile, accumulating evidence suggests that CTMP plays vital roles in numerous pathological processes, such as tumor,8neuroprotection,14and metabolism.15Initially, CTMP has been determined to exert a complex influence in multiple cancers by regulating cell survival, proliferat"

See:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/.PMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC10582970 PMID:37827810AbstractCardiac function is characterised by haemodynamic parameters in the clinical scenario. Due to recent development in imaging techniques, the clinicians focus on the quantitative assessment of left ventricular size, shape and motion patterns mostly analysed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Because of the physiologically known antagonistic structure and function of the heart muscle, the effective performance of the heart remains hidden behind haemodynamic parameters. In fact, a smaller component of oblique transmural netting of cardiac muscle fibres simultaneously engenders contracting and dilating force vectors, while the predominant mass of the tangentially aligned fibres only acts in one direction. In case of hypertrophy, an increased influence of the dilating transmural fibre component might counteract systolic wall thickening, thereby counteract cardiac output. A further important aspect is the response to inotropic stimulation that is different for the tangentially aligned fibre component in comparison to the transmural component. Both aspects highlight the importance to integrate the analysis of intramural fibre architecture into the clinical cardiac diagnostics.Keywords:Cardiac Imaging Techniques; Hypertension; Cardiomyopathy, HypertrophicIntroductionAlmost all biological systems usually have an antagonistic principle of function since counteracting components enable finely graduated adjustments of function by action and counteraction. A separate measurement of the intramural deformation of individual cardiac muscle fibres and their force development is not yet possible. Otto Frank has described the pressure–volume relations of the frog ventricle mainly in relation to the ventricular filling conditions.1 2Patterson and Starling showed the relation between ventricular filling pressure and cardiac output3analysing the impact of contractile forces due to ventricular preload. The analysis of the myocardial ultrastructure by electron microscopy and the correlation between morphological alterations and function of the sarcomeres4–6gave insights into the tension–length relationship of the myocardial fibres. Assuming a strictly tangential arrangement of the fibre architecture within the ventricular walls, the prevailing opinion was determined that the vectors of contractile forces are exclusively parallel to the ventricular surface contour assuming no antagonism of contractile forces within the myocardium, which was not considered in Frank’s model of ventricular function.1Therefore, currently used terms like myoc"

Although these models allow for the identification of candidate mechanistic pathways, many models involve supraphysiological dosages, nonphysiological conditions, or experimental changes relating to individual proteins or receptors, all of which limit translation to human trials. To overcome these drawbacks, the use of ex vivo human plasma and serum has been used in cellular models to investigate changes in myotube hypertrophy, cellular protein synthesis, anabolic and catabolic markers in response to differing age, disease states, and nutrient status. However, there are currently no concurrent guidelines outlining the optimal methodology for this model. This review discusses the key methodological considerations surrounding the use of ex vivo plasma and serum with a focus in application to skeletal muscle cell lines (i.e., C2C12, L6, and LHCN-M2) and human primary skeletal muscle cells (HSMCs) as a means to investigate molecular signaling in models of atrophy and hypertrophy, alongside future directions.INTRODUCTIONOver recent years the use of in vitro models in muscle physiology research has allowed for valuable investigations into the intracellular mechanisms of cellular growth and atrophy (1–3). Common in vitro models of skeletal muscle growth and atrophy include the use of immortalized cell lines obtained from mice (C2C12), rats (L6), and humans (LHCN-M2), induced through the incorporation of pharmacological treatments including insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), dexamethasone, and TNF- to investigate alterations in myoblast proliferation and muscle protein synthesis (MPS;4–8). Although pharmacologically induced models of growth and atrophy highlight key targets of interest for further investigation, translation to in vivo human work may be limited. This may be partly due to basal culturing conditions. Immortalized skeletal muscle cell lines such as C2C12 are routinely cultured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with animal-derived s"

To achieve this, mTORC1-IRS-1/2 signaling, BiP/CHOP/IRE1α, and AMPK activation were determined in rat plantaris muscle following synergist ablation (SA). SA resulted in significant increases in muscle mass of ∼4% per day throughout the 21 days of the experiment. The expression of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) were high throughout the 21st day of overload. However, IGF signaling was limited, since IRS-1 and -2 were undetectable in the overloaded muscle fromday 3today 9. The decreases in IRS-1/2 protein were paralleled by increases in GRB10 Ser501/503and S6K1 Thr389phosphorylation, two mTORC1 targets that can destabilize IRS proteins. PKB Ser473phosphorylation was higher from 3–6 days, and this was associated with increased TSC2 Thr939phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of TSC2Thr1345(an AMPK site) was also elevated, whereas phosphorylation at the other PKB site, Thr1462, was unchanged at 6 days. In agreement with the phosphorylation of Thr1345, SA led to activation of AMPKα1 during the initial growth phase, lasting the first 9 days before returning to baseline byday 12. The UPR markers CHOP and BiP were elevated over the first 12 days following ablation, whereas IRE1α levels decreased. These data suggest that during supraphysiological muscle loading at least three potential molecular brakes engage to downregulate mTORC1.skeletal muscle mass is determinedby net protein balance within the muscle. During periods of growth, the rate of protein synthesis is greater than degradation (34). Load-induced increases in ana"

This phenomenon occurs when untreated upper muscle layers hypertrophy to compensate for weakened lower regions, disrupting facial symmetry. Traditional injection strategies, focused on the lower muscle bulk, overlook the masseter's complex three‐layered anatomy (superficial, middle, deep), increasing asymmetry risks.MethodsTo prevent compensatory bulging, a retrograde, layered injection technique is proposed, distributing botulinum neurotoxin evenly across the upper, middle, and lower masseter. Ultrasound guidance enhances precision, ensuring toxin delivery to targeted layers while avoiding diffusion into adjacent muscles (e.g., risorius). Personalized dosing, adjusted for muscle thickness, activity, and treatment history, minimizes localized over‐atrophy.ResultsA 34‐year‐old female developed upper masseter bulging after four lower mid‐masseter botulinum toxin sessions over two years. Ultrasound revealed upper hypoechoic hypertrophy (12 mm thickness) contrasting with lower hyperechoic atrophy (5 mm). Injecting 50 units of LetibotulinumtoxinA into the upper masseter reduced hypertrophy (8 mm post‐treatment), restoring facial symmetry.DiscussionCompensatory bulging underscores the need for holistic treatment addressing the entire muscle. Layered injections, guided by ultrasound and tailored dosing, mitigate asymmetry risks. Clinicians must adopt comprehensive strategies, integrating anatomical insights and advanced imaging, to optimize aesthetic outcomes in masseter hypertrophy management.1. IntroductionMasseter muscle hypertrophy is a prevalent aesthetic concern, particularly in individuals of East Asian descent, where a broad, square‐shaped lower face is often considered less desirable. This condition, characterized by the enlargement of the masseter muscles, contributes to a wider and more angular facial appearance. Botulinum neurotoxin injections have become a widely accepted nonsurgical solution for reducing the size of these muscles, allowing for a softer and more streamlined facial contour [1,2,3,4]. The effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin in aesthetic medicine is well established, particularly in its ability to inhibit acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, thereby reducing muscle activity and leading to gradual atrophy [5]. However, the masseter muscle's complexity, with its three distinct layers—superficial, middle, and deep—poses treatment challenges. These layers, with their varied origins and insertions along the zygomatic arch and mandible, require precise targeting to achieve desired outcomes without adverse effects. Traditionally, botulinum neurotoxin injections for masseter hypertrophy have focused on the lower mid‐part of the muscle, where the bulk is most prominent [4]. While this approach effectively reduces muscle mass in the targeted area, repeated treatments can lead to unintended consequences.A novel phenomenon, referred to as compensatory masseteric bulging, has been identified and described in this article. This condition occurs when the upper portion of the masseter muscle undergoes hypertrophy as a compensatory response to the repeated weakening of the lower mid‐part of the muscle. This phenomenon has not been previously documented in the literature, and it presents a unique challenge in the management of masseter hypertrophy. Compensatory masseteric bulging can lead to an uneven and asymmetrical facial appearance, counteracting the intended aesthe"

The compensatory overload was induced in the rat medial gastrocnemius (MG) by bilateral tenotomy of its synergists (lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris); as a result, only the MG was able to evoke the foot plantar flexion. To assure regular activation of the MG muscle, rats were placed in wheel-equipped cages and subjected to a low-level treadmill exercise. The intracellular recordings from MG motoneurons were made after 5 or 12 wk of the overload, and in a control group of intact rats. Some of the passive and threshold membrane properties as well as rhythmic firing properties were considerably modified in fast-type MNs, while remaining unaltered in slow-type MNs. The significant changes included a shortening of the spike duration and the spike rise time, an increase of the afterhyperpolarization amplitude, an increase of the input resistance, a decrease of the rheobase, and a decrease of the minimum current necessary to evoke steady-state firing. The data suggest higher excitability of fast-type MNs innervating the overloaded muscle, and a shift towards electrophysiological properties of slow-type MNs. All of the adaptations could be observed after 5 wk of the compensatory overload with no further changes occurring after 12 wk. This indicates that the response to an increased level of chronic activation of MNs is relatively quick and stable.muscle overload can be achievedby workload training (Fry 2004;McDonagh and Davies 1984), ablation or tenotomy of synergists (Gardiner et al. 1991;Noble and Pettigrew 1989;Olha et al. 1988), peripheral nerve damage, or denervation of synergistic muscles (Degens et al. 1995). Overload induces measurable adaptive effects in the whole muscle, its motor units (MUs), and individual muscle fibers. The most prominent response is muscle hypertrophy, reflected in the increase of muscle mass, cross-section area, and the increased strength (Allbrook 1981;Seynnes et al. 2006). Some biochemical adaptations related to this hypertrophy have been reported in muscle fibers (Baldwin et al. 1982;Dearth et al. 2013;Ianuzzo and Chen 1979). Several studies have reported changes in contractile properties of MUs in response to chronic musc"

In isometric twitches,ACTCE99K papillary muscle produced three to four times greater force than non-TG muscle under the same conditions independent of stimulation frequency and temperature, whereas maximum isometric force in myofibrils from these muscles was not significantly different.ACTCE99K muscle relaxed slower than non-TG muscle in both papillary muscle (1.4×) and myofibrils (1.7×), whereas the rate of force development after stimulation was the same as non-TG muscle for both electrical stimulation in intact muscle and after a Ca2+jump in myofibrils. The EC50for Ca2+activation of force in myofibrils was 0.39 ± 0.33 μmol/l inACTCE99K myofibrils and 0.80 ± 0.11 μmol/l in non-TG myofibrils. There were no significant differences in the amplitude and time course of the Ca2+transient in myocytes fromACTCE99K and non-TG mice. We conclude that hypercontractility is caused by higher myofibrillar Ca2+sensitivity inACTCE99K muscles. Measurement of the energy (work + heat) released in actively cycling heart muscle showed that for both genotypes, the amount of energy turnover increased with work done but with decreasing efficiency as energy turnover increased. Thus,ACTCE99K mouse heart muscle produced on average 3.3-fold more work than non-TG muscle, and the cost in terms of energy turnover was disproportionately higher than in non-TG muscles. Efficiency forACTCE99K muscle was in the range of 11–16% and for non-TG muscle was 15–18%.hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is the most common monogenic inherited cardiomyopathy; its incidence is believed to be as high as 0.2% of the population. It is characterized by hypertrophy of the muscle of the heart, especial"

During the compensatory phase of the hypertrophic response the myocardium maintains output and is characterized by a coordinated neo-angiogenic and fibrotic response that supports cardiomyocyte health and survival. Emerging evidence shows that paracrine-mediated cross-talk between cardiac myocytes and non-myocytes within the heart is critical for cardiac adaptation to stress, including the extent of hypertrophy and angiogenesis. This review will discuss recent results indicating that Placental Growth Factor (PGF, also called PlGF), a secreted factor within the VEGF superfamily, is a pivotal mediator of adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and beneficial angiogenesis through its ability to coordinate the intercellular communication between different celltypes in the heart.IntroductionThe heart is a dynamic organ able to respond to environmental insults or stress stimuli by remodeling and hypertrophy. These events are typically compensatory as a means of maintaining cardiac output and reducing ventricular wall stress after myocardial infarction, with myocarditis, aortic stenosis, hypertension, valve defects, or mutations in genes that affect myocyte contractility. Although the origin of the injury often varies, the remodeling of the stressed heart is commonly associated with cardiac hypertrophy and, over extended periods of time, this can lead to heart failure and death (Kehat et al. 2010). Cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in the production and release of catecholamines, growth factors, and cytokines that together contribute to the growth of cardiomyocytes, blood vessels and capillaries, as well as interstitial connective tissue through activation of fibroblasts. In fact, although the growth of the cardiomyocyte is the most prominent feature associated with hypertrophy, it is now evident that this process intimately involves non-myocytes within the heart such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells (Baudino et al. 2006). The growth of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, a process termed fibrosis, is considered to be a maladaptive response that contributes to ventricular arrhythmia and left ventricular dysfunction (Sabbah et al. 1995). Yet, fibroblasts may also play an adaptive role in hypertrophy, underlying the importance of understanding the mechanisms leading to a balanced response. Indeed, the extracellular matrix of the heart is a complex milieu containing structural proteins, growth factor binding proteins, and signaling factors that orchestrate the communication between myocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in coordinating hypertrophy, fibrosis and angiogenesis. For example, a coordinated increase in vessel/capillary density is typically necessary to provide oxygen and nutrients as the cardiomyocytes enlarge, which in turn requires increased deposition of extracellular matrix to provide mechanical support and elasticity for contraction (Walsh et al. 2007). Impaired vascular growth and abnormal extracellular matrix deposition are common maladaptive features that accelerate the transition from compensated to decompensated hypertrophy (Bowers et al. 2010). Due to the importance of paracrine communication between these celltypes in the heart during stress stimulation, much effort has been put forth towards identifying secreted factors in the he"

However, most studies have work-matched LL-BFR and LL-RE. Completing sets to similar perceived efforts, thereby allowing for a variable amount of work, may provide a more ecologically valid approach to compare LL-BFR and LL-RE. This study aimed to examine acute signaling and training responses following LL-RE or LL-BFR performed to task failure. Ten participants had each leg randomly assigned to perform LL-RE or LL-BFR. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and 2-h after the first exercise bout and after 6-wk of training for Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Repeated measure ANOVA and intraclass coefficients (ICCs) were used to compare responses of each condition. After exercise, AKT(T308)phosphorylation increased after LL-RE and LL-BFR (both ∼145% of baseline,P< 0.05) and trended for p70 S6K(T389)(LL-RE: ∼158% and LL-BFR: ∼137%,P= 0.06). BFR did not alter these responses, resulting in fair-excellent ICCs for signaling proteins involved in anabolism (ICCAKT(T308)= 0.889,P= 0.001; ICCAKT(S473)= 0.519,P= 0.074; ICCp70 S6K(T389)= 0.514,P= 0.105). After training, muscle fiber cross-sectional area and vastus lateralis whole muscle thickness were similar between conditions (ICC ≥ 0.637,P≤ 0.031). Similar acute and chronic responses between conditions and high ICC values between legs suggest that both LL-BFR and LL-RE performed by the same person result in similar adaptations. These data support the concept that sufficient muscular exertion is a key factor for training-induced muscle hypertrophy with low-load resistance exercise independent of total work and blood flow.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThe addition of blood flow restriction during low-load resistance exercise is considered to increase the signaling events and muscle growth responses to a greater extent than low-load resistance exercise alone. It remains unclear whether blood flow restriction accelerates or increases these adaptive responses, as most studies have each condition perform the same amount of work. Despite different amounts of work performed, we show similar signaling and muscle growth responses occur after low-load resistance exercise with and without blood flow restriction. Our work supports that blood flow restriction accelerates fatigue but does not increase the signaling events and muscle growth responses during low-load resistance exercise.INTRODUCTIONLow-load resistance exercise with blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) has been shown to induce greater muscular hypertrophy than low-load resistance exercise (LL-RE) with conserved blood flow (1–4). Research in the past two decades has "

Spangenburg.Author AffiliationsAssistant Professor University of Maryland.to the editor:This is a timely Point:Counterpoint that addresses the role of IGF-I in the regulation of muscle mass. Clearly, IGF-I is critical for muscle development and postnatal muscle growth (2). However, its role in the area of load-induced muscle hypertrophy has been recently questioned (5). There are a few clarifications that should be made, in that the mice used in my study are not knockouts of the IGF-I receptor as implicated by Flüeck and Goldspink (6), but they are transgenic mice that contain a point mutation in the ATP binding domain resulting in abrogated IGF-I receptor function in a dominant negative fashion. Second, one of the key points of my findings was that it was possible for mechanical load to activate mTOR signaling independent of the IGF-I receptor. There are other critical pieces of evidence that must be considered as well. In response to acute loading, the increase in IGF-I production by the muscle occurs over a matter of days (1), while activation of the mTOR signaling is activated in a matter of minutes to hours (4). Furthermore, a major critical aspect of IGF-I signaling is Akt activation; however, the magnitude of phosphorylation and duration of activation of Akt in response to acute mechanical loading is substantially smaller compared to downstream components of mTOR (i.e. p70s6k) (4). Thus, unless IGF-I bypasses Akt to induce protein synthesis, it would suggest that mTOR is likely activated independent of Akt and IGF-I. Stewart and Pell (6) suggest that all muscle growth is dependent on satellite cell activation (6); however, mechanical load can induce smaller increases in muscle mass independent of satellite cell activation (3). Thus, if the major role of IGF-I is to affect satellite cell function and there are cases where we can get growth of muscle without satellite cell activation, then we must conclude IGF-I is not always necessary for muscle growth.REFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein accumulation during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Appl Physiol81: 2509–2516,1996.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar2.Liu JP , Baker J , Perkins AS , Robertson EJ , Efstratiadis A.Mice carrying null mutations of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor I (Igf-1) and type 1 IGF receptor (Igf1r).Cell75: 59–72,1993.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar3.Mitchell PO , Pavlath GK.A muscle precursor cell-dependent pathway contributes to muscle growth after atrophy.Am J Physiol Cell Physiol281: C1706–C1715,2001.Link|Web of Science|Google Scholar4.O'Neil TK , Duffy LR , Frey JW , Hornberger TA.The role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphatidic acid in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin following eccentric contractions.J Physiol587: 3691–3701,2009.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar5.Spangenburg EE , Le Roith D , Ward CW , Bodine SC.A functional insulin-like growth factor receptor is not necessary for load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.J Physiol586: 283–291,2008.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar6.Stewart C , Pell JM , Flueck M , Goldspink G.Point:Counterpoint: IGF is/is not the major physiological regulator of muscle mass.J Appl Physiol. doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01246.2009.Web of Science|Google ScholarREFERENCES1.Adams GR , Haddad F.The relationships among IGF-1, DNA content, and protein a"

However, whether skeletal phenotype can be oriented or not during early embryonic stages has never been investigated. Here, we report that pyruvate as the only source of carbohydrate in the culture medium of mouse one cell stage embryo influenced the establishment of the muscular phenotype in adulthood. We found that pyruvate alone induced changes in the contractile phenotype of the skeletal muscle in a sexually dependent manner. For male mice, a switch to a more glycolytic phenotype was recorded, whereas, in females, the pyruvate induced a switch to a more oxidative phenotype. In addition, the influence of pyruvate on the contractile phenotypes was confirmed in two mouse models of muscle hypertrophy: the well-known myostatin deficient mouse (Mstn−/−) and a mouse carrying a specific deletion of p43, a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor. Finally, to understand the link between these adult phenotypes and the early embryonic period, we assessed the levels of two histone H3 post-translational modifications in presence of pyruvate alone just after the wave of chromatin reprogramming specific of the first cell cycle. We showed that H3K4 acetylation level was decreased in Mstn−/− 2-cell embryos, whereas no difference was found for H3K27 trimethylation level, whatever the genotype. These findings demonstrate for t"

However, cardiovascular risk and protective effects of pioglitazone remain controversial.ObjectivesIn this study, we investigated whether pioglitazone affects cardiomyocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy by regulating the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway.MethodsCardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated from 1- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat ventricles. Effects of pioglitazone and the VEGFR-2-selective inhibitor apatinib on cardiomyocyte apoptotic rate was determined using flow cytometry, and hypertrophy was evaluated using [3H]-leucine incorporation. The protein expressions of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated VEGFR-2, Akt, P53, and mTOR were determined by Western-Blotting. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the differences between groups.ResultsPioglitazone and VEGFR-2-selective inhibitor apatinib reduced rat cardiomyocyte viability and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II in vitro. Furthermore, in the same in vitro model, pioglitazone and apatinib significantly increased the expression of Bax and phosphorylated P53 and decreased the expression of phosphorylated VEGFR-2, Akt, and mTOR, which promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that pioglitazone induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by modulating the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway.Keywords:Apoptosis; Myocytes, Cardiac; Cardiomegaly; Heart Failure/physiopathology; Antihypertensive Agents; Thiazolidinediones; Insulin ResistanceIntroductionHeart failure (HF) is the most common consequence of cardiovascular diseases and the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide.1Basic pathophysiology of HF is cardiac remodeling, which involves a number of cellular changes including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptosis, necrosis, fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis.2Recent fundamental and clinical studies have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus (DM) drives cardiac remodeling, including myocardial hypertrophy and cardiomyocytes loss, via glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, eventually resulting in HF.3Intensive glucose control was shown to reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events including HF, but did not improve the overall survival rate in patients with type 2 DM, compared to patients receiving standard therapy.3Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, have been widel"

Here, we examined the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Magic-F1 in comparison with Pax3 (paired box gene 3) transcription factor during embryogenesis. Ranging from 9.5 to 17.5 dpc (days post coitum) mouse embryos were analyzed byin situhybridization using whole mounts during early stages of development (9.5–10.5–11.5 dpc) and cryostat sections for later stages (11.5–13.5–15.5–17.5 dpc). We found that Magic-F1 is expressed in developing organs and tissues of mesenchymal origin, where Pax3 signal appears to be downregulated respect to the wt embryos. These data suggest that Magic-F1 could be responsible of muscular hypertrophy, cooperating with Pax3 signal pathway in skeletal muscle precursor cells.1. IntroductionMuscular hypertrophy is controlled by both muscle growth and muscle atrophy. These apparently contrasting biological processes share key molecules triggering active transcriptional programs to induce skeletal muscles atrophy or hypertrophy.The IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) pathway affects both hypertrophy and atrophy, increasing protein synthesis and inhibiting the expression of transcription factor FOXO (forkhead box O), respectively. A key molecular player downstream of IGF-1 receptor is Akt (Abelson leukemia kinase) that when phosphorylated activates protein synthesis via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The two main actors to negatively control the muscle growth are myostatin and atrogin-"

How ENDOG controls cardiomyocyte growth is still unknown. Thus, we aimed at finding the link between ENDOG activity and cardiomyocyte growth.Endogdeficiency induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and abnormal growth in neonatal rodent cardiomyocytes, altering the AKT-GSK3β and Class-II histone deacethylases (HDAC) signal transduction pathways. These effects were blocked by ROS scavengers. Lack of ENDOG reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication independently of ROS accumulation. Because mtDNA encodes several subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, whose activity is an important source of cellular ROS, we investigated whetherEndogdeficiency compromised the expression and activity of the respiratory chain complexes but found no changes in these parameters nor in ATP content. MtDNA also codes for humanin, a micropeptide with possible metabolic functions. Nanomolar concentrations of synthetic humanin restored normal ROS levels and cell size inEndog-deficient cardiomyocytes. These results support the involvement of redox signaling in the control of cardiomyocyte growth by ENDOG and suggest a pathway relating mtDNA content to the regulation of cell growth probably involving humanin, which prevents reactive ox"

It has been shown that endothelial cells contribute to this process through endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) due to inductive signals such as TGF-β. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has proven effective in preserving systolic function and delaying the onset of failure. In this study, we hypothesize that VEGF inhibits EndMT and prevents cardiac fibrosis, thereby preserving diastolic function.MethodsNewborn rabbits underwent banding of the descending aorta. At 4 and 6wks, hypertrophied animals (H) were treated with intrapericardial VEGF protein (T) and compared to controls (C; n=6/groups). Weekly transthoracic echocardiography measured peak systolic stress. At 7wks, diastolic stiffness was determined through pressure-volume curves, fibrosis by Masson’s Trichrome (MT) and hydroxyproline assay (HP), EndMT by immunohistochemistry, and activation of TGF-β and SMAD2/3 by qRT-PCR.ResultsPeak systolic stress was preserved during the entire observation period and diastolic compliance was maintained in T (H:20±1 versus T:11±3 and C:12±2, p<0.05). Collagen was significantly higher in H (MT: H:3.1±0.9 versus T:1.8±0.6, and HP: H:2.8±0.6 versus T:1.4±0.4; p<0.05). Fluorescent immunostaining showed active EndMT in H, but significantly less in T, which was directly associated with a significant increase in TGF-β/SMAD-2 mRNA expression.ConclusionsEndMT contributes to cardiac fibrosis in hypertrophied hearts. VEGF treatment inhibits EndMT and prevents the deposition of collagen that leads to myocardial stiffness through TGF-β/SMAD-dependent activation. This presents a therapeutic opportunity to prevent diastolic failure and preserve cardiac function in pressure-loaded hearts.Keywords:hypertrophy, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibrosis, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitionIn response to increased pressure loading, the myocardium adjusts by altering myocardial structure and function. This series of complex cellular and molecular changes ultimately leads to the progression of compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. Cardiomyocytes are central to the contractile function of the myocardium but the cardiac interstitium and its fibrillar collagen matrix also play a critical role in cardiac performance (1). Morphological changes involve hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, but the destruction of the dynamic balance within the extracellular matrix, affecting vascularization, and collagen synthesis and degradation is equally as important (2,3,4). During the compensated stage of hypertrophy, these changes permit the parallel increase in cardiomyocyte growth and collagen deposition. In contrast, later, excess deposition of collagen occurs as a result of c"

Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e. myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e. myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID]). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.Research organism:MouseeLife digestApproximately 45% of human body mass is made of skeletal muscle.

    "content": "AbstractThis article comments on the study by Schoenfeld, et al. entitled “The effect of protein timing on muscle strength and hypertrophy: a meta-analysis” and discusses how the methodology led to inconclusive results.Keywords:PlaceboMuscle StrengthTraining SessionSport MedicineInternational SocietyRecently, Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition published a meta-analysis to determine whether consuming protein in and around a workout enhanced strength and muscular development [Citation1]. In the paper, the authors argue that the results refute the claim that protein intake timing around training sessions positively influences strength and muscular adaptations. However, most of the studies chosen for analysis were not even suitable to answer the study question.Twenty of the 23 studies in the meta-analysis compared protein supplement to placebo and of these 20 studies none matched total daily protein intake between groups. Therefore, the studies afford no reasonable assessment of whether timing of protein intake around exercise is beneficial because higher total daily protein intake is a confounding factor. Only 3 studies in the meta-analysis would be applicable to the question of protein timing [Citation2–Citation4]. This is because the studies compared protein supplement intake in and around workouts to supplement intake some time before and after. The sample sizes were small and the 3 studies comprised a total of 77 subjects. The authors’ assertion that the study had “good statistical power” due to the sample size of about 500 subjects is belied by the use of only 3 relevant studies.FundingNo funding provided for this article.Author contributionsDavid J.

In the attempt to clarify the question about the possible contribution of myonuclei to the phenomenon of muscle memory, Psilander et al. (4) showed a lack of significant variation of myonuclei in skeletal muscle fibers during training and detraining. The Viewpoint recently published by Murach et al. (2) focused the attention on what happens during the detraining phase and gives the opportunity to reanalyze the data of Psilander et al. (4), which are publicly available, showing that, among the 11 subjects who increased myonuclear number (normalized to fiber length) after training, 7 underwent a loss and 4 an accretion of myonuclei number during the detraining phase. Our data recently published on a group of oldest-old individuals confined to wheelchair for the last two years suggest that the issue of myonuclear adaptation in disuse could be more complicated (3). Surprisingly, we observed in vastus lateralis muscle of immobilized individuals a greater myonuclear density (myonuclei/mm fiber) compared with age-matched subjects still able to walk. It is unclear whether this is due to the persistence of myonuclei in atrophic fibers or to a fiber type shift, as in those subjects we observed a slow-to-fast transition, or to other mechanisms with a compensatory effect.REFERENCES1.Bruusgaard JC, Johansen IB, Egner IM, Rana ZA, Gundersen K.Myonuclei acquired by overload exercise precede hypertrophy and are not lost on detraining.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA107: 15111–15116,2010. doi:10.1073/pnas.0913935107.Crossref|PubMed|Web of Science|Google Scholar2.Murach KA, Dungan CM, Dupont-Versteegden EE, McCarthy JJ, Peterson CA.“Muscle memory” not mediated by myonuclear number?

All rights reserved.PMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC3129375 NIHMSID: NIHMS298431 PMID:21621505The publisher's version of this article is available atArch Biochem BiophysAbstractSelenium (Se) is thought to confer cardioprotective effects through the actions of antioxidant selenoprotein enzymes that directly limit levels of ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or that reverse oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. To determine how the selenoproteome responds to myocardial hypertrophy, two mouse models were employed: triidothyronine (T3)- or isoproterenol (ISO)-treatment. After 7 days of T3- and ISO-treatment, cardiac stress was demonstrated by increased H2O2and caspase-3 activity. Neither treatment produced significant increases in phospholipid peroxidation or TUNEL-positive cells, suggesting that antioxidant systems were protecting the cardiomyocytes from damage. Many selenoprotein mRNAs were induced by T3- and ISO-treatment, with levels of methionine sulfoxide reductase 1 (MsrB1, also called SelR) mRNA showing the largest increases. MsrB enzymatic activity was also elevated in both models of cardiac stress, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and thioredoxin reductase (Trxrd) activity were moderately and nonsignificantly increased, respectively. Western blot assays revealed a marked increase in MsrB1 and moderate increases in GPx3, GPx4, and Trxrd1, particularly in T3-treated hearts. Thus, the main response of the selenoproteome during hypertrophy does not involve increased GPx1, but increased GPx3 for reducing extracellular H2O2and increased GPx4, Trxrd1, and MsrB1 for minimizing intracellular oxidative damage.Keywords:Selenoproteins, cardiac stress, hypertrophy, oxidative stress, antioxidant1 IntroductionOxidative stress is induced in the heart by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated in many cardiovascular disorders [1,2]. Two useful mouse models of cardiac stress that induce increased contractility and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are treatment with thyroid hormone, triidothyronine (T3), or the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO). Both treatments exert profound effects on the heart and cardiovascular system. Hyperthyroidism produces a well-recognized spectrum of cardiovascular perturbations that include increased heart rate and contractility, elevated cardiac output, and eventual cardiac hypertrophy [3,4]. ISO-treatment also causes an increase in heart rate and contractility without increasing systemic blood pressure [5]. Both treatments cause increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Over long periods, these hemodynamic changes can ultimately lead to “high output” heart failure and some data suggest that increased oxidative stress contributes to cardiac pathology caused by hyperthyroidism or chronic catecholamine exposure [6–10]. Excessive or sustained ROS may damage cellular constituents including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. In addition, evidence is emerging for a direct role of ROS i"

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study, we revealed that MIF deficiency overtly exacerbated abdominal aorta constriction–induced cardiac hypertrophy and contractile anomalies. MIF deficiency interrupted myocardial autophagy in hypertrophied hearts. Rapamycin administration mitigated the exacerbated hypertrophic responses in MIF−/−mice. Using the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in vitro model in H9C2 myoblasts, we confirmed that MIF governed the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin–autophagy cascade. Confocal microscopic examination demonstrated that MIF depletion prevented phenylephrine-induced mitophagy in H9C2 myoblasts. Myocardial Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a marker for mitophagy, was significantly upregulated after sustained pressure overload, the effect of which was prevented by MIF knockout. Furthermore, our data exhibited that levels of MIF, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and autophagy were elevated concurrently in human failing hearts. These data indicate that endogenous MIF regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling to activate autophagy to preserve cardiac geometry and protect against hypertrophic responses.IntroductionHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure and sudden death.1,2Cardiac hypertrophy develops in compensation to pressure overload and is characterized by increased cardiomyocyte size, re-expression of fetal genes, and activation of signaling pathways governing protein synthesis and interstitial fibrosis.3Although the precise mechanism underlying cardiac hypertrophy still remains elusive, several signaling molecules have been identified in the onset and development of cardiac hypertrophy, including Ras/Raf/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade,4phosphoinositide 3 kinase-Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3,5AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),6,7and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).8,9Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells including cardiomyocytes.10Ample evidence has suggested that MIF is involved in the regulation of cardiac function under pathological conditions, including burn,11diabetes mellitus,12and ischemia–reperfusion injury.10,13The cardioprotective effect of MIF seems to be mediated by several signaling molecules including AMPK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase).10,13Although MIF may be indispensable in pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy, the precise mechanism still remains elusive.14The autophagy–lysosome pathway, which regulates protein and organelle degradation and recycling,15is essential to cardiomyocyte homeostasis.16However, the precise role of autophagy in cardiac geometry and function under pathological conditions still remains controversial. For example, autophagy initiation was found to be detrimental to pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.17,18On the contrary, other studies have suggested that autophagy activation may be protective in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.19Recent evidence also revealed a pivotal role of mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy in interrupted mitochondrial integrity and cardiac homeostasis. In particular, Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase localized in the cytoplasm, may be recruited to the damaged mitochondria under mitochondrial stress.20Thus, this study was designed to examine the role of MIF in the development of cardiac hypertrophy after pressure overload and the underlying mechanisms with a focus on autophagy. A murine model of moderate pressure overload was used in wild-type (WT) and MIF knockout (MIF−/−) mice using abdominal aortic constriction or sham surgery.3Materials and MethodsPlease refer to Materials and Methods in the online-only Data Supplement for the full description of experimental procedures.ResultsMIF Deficiency Accentuates Pressure Overload–Induced Cardiac DysfunctionFour weeks after abdominal aorta constriction (AAC) surgery, pressure overload did not affect the survival in WT mice, although it significantly enhanced mortality rate in MIF−/−mice (Figure 1A).

These divergent patterns of hypertrophy were related 40 years ago to disparate wall stresses in both conditions, with systolic wall stress eliciting parallel replication of sarcomeres and diastolic wall stress, series replication. These observations are relevant to clinical practice, as they relate to the excessive hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction regularly observed in patients with aortic stenosis. Stress-sensing mechanisms in cardiomyocytes and activation of cardiomyocyte death by elevated wall stress continue to intrigue cardiovascular scientists.Pattern recognition in left ventricular hypertrophyPressure and volume overload result in divergent patterns of LV hypertrophy. The presence of LV hypertrophy implies a higher-than-normal myocardial mass. Pressure overload usually elicits concentric hypertrophy, with a high ratio of LV wall thickness to radius (h/R). In contrast, volume overload triggers eccentric hypertrophy with a normal h/R ratio (Figure1). Nearly 40 years ago, an article in these pages related the divergent patterns of LV hypertrophy to disparate LV wall stresses in both conditions (1). In patients with aortic stenosis, both systolic and diastolic LV wall stresses were normal because concentric hypertrophy had succeeded in nicely counterbalancing the effect on LV wall stress of elevated systolic and diastolic LV pressures. Concentric hypertrophy was therefore labeled an adaptive mechanism, which avoids afterload excess to hinder myocardial shortening. In contrast, eccentric hypertrophy, as observed in patients with mitral or aortic regurgitation, corrected systolic LV wall stress but failed to normalize diastolic LV wall stress. Although eccentric hypertrophy resembled physiological growth, its effect on diastolic wall stress suggested that maladaptive hypertrophy develops insidiously during volume overload.Figure 1. Schematic overview of the development of concentric hypertrophy with the parallel addition of sarcomeres in pressure overload and of eccentric hypertrophy with a series addition of sarcomeres in volume overload.Open in a new tabChamber enlargement increases systolic wall stress in volume overload (dashed black arrow indicates positive feedback). Wall thickening induces concentric hypertrophy in pressure overload and contributes to eccentric hypertrophy in volume overload (blue arrow). Concentric hypertrophy reduces systolic wall stress in pressure overload, and eccentric hypertrophy reduces diastolic wall stress in volume overload (dashed red lines indicate negative feedback).Based on the development of concentric hypertrophy in pressure overload and eccentric hypertrophy in volume overload, peak systolic wall stress was proposed as a stimulus for parallel replication of sarcomeres in concentric hypertrophy and end-diastolic wall stress as a stimulus for series replication of cardiomyocytes in eccentric hypertrophy (1). A reflection of LV remodeling in cardiomyocyte remodeling was confirmed more than two decades later by detailed histomorphometric measurements in concentric and eccentric human or animal LV hypertrophy (2). In concentric LV hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes only grow in a transverse direction while keeping cell length constant, whereas in eccentric LV hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes grow proportionally in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The difference in cardiomyocyte remodeling is also reflected in distinct patterns of peptide growth factor induction i"

However, the mechanism governing progression of hypertrophy to apoptosis at the single-cell level remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate annexin A6 (Anxa6), a calcium (Ca2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding protein critically regulates the transition of chronic hypertrophied cardiomyocytes to apoptosis. Treatment of the H9c2(2-1) cardiomyocytes with hypertrophic agonists upregulates and relocalizes Anxa6 with increased cytosolic punctate appearance. Live cell imaging revealed that chronic exposure to hypertrophic agonists such as phenylephrine (PE) compromises the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and morphological dynamics. Such chronic hypertrophic induction also activated the caspases 9 and 3 and induced cleavage of the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1), which are the typical downstream events in the mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. An increased rate of apoptosis was evident in the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes after 48–72 h of treatment with the hypertrophic agonists. Anxa6 was progressively associated with the mitochondrial fraction under chronic hypertrophic stimulation, and Anxa6 knockdown severely abrogated mitochondrial network and dynamics. Ectopically expressed Anxa6 protected the mitochondrial morphology and dynamics under PE treatment, and also increased the cellular susceptibility to apoptosis. Biochemical analysis showed that Anxa6 interacts with Parp1 and its 89 kDa cleaved product in a Ca2+-dependent manner through the N-terminal residues (1–28). Furthermore, expression of Anxa6S13E, a mutant dominant negative with respect to Parp1 binding, served as an enhancer of mitochondrial dynamics, even under chronic PE treatment. Chemical inhibition of Parp1 activity released the cellular vulnerability to apoptosis in Anxa6-expressing stable cell lines, thereby shifting the equilibrium away from cell death. Taken together, the present study depicts a dual regulatory function of Anxa6 that is crucial for balancing hypertrophy with apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.Complex machineries govern the life and death decisions in mammalian cells through a dynamic equilibrium, which is essential for physiological homeostasis.1Such equilibrium is critical for cardiac myocytes because of their terminally differentiated states and low proliferative capacities. Stress response in cardiomyocytes often involves a switch between survival and cell death pathways.2,3,4Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is an adaptive response to stress, which may turn maladaptive and fatal,5as evident in cardiovascular disorders that leads to heart failure.6Hypertrophied phenotypes are also associated with a balance between cell growth and programmed cell death.7These processes are aided by seve"

A positive or negative influence of individual eicosanoid species [e.g., prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids] has been implicated in skeletal muscle cell growth and development. The collective role of AA-derived metabolites in physiological states of skeletal muscle growth/atrophy remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the direct effect of free AA supplementation and subsequent eicosanoid biosynthesis on skeletal myocyte growth in vitro.C2C12 (mouse) skeletal myocytes induced to differentiate with supplemental AA exhibited dose-dependent increases in the size, myonuclear content, and protein accretion of developing myotubes, independent of changes in cell density or the rate/extent of myogenic differentiation. Nonselective (indomethacin) or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-selective (NS-398) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs blunted basal myogenesis, an effect that was amplified in the presence of supplemental free AA substrate. The stimulatory effects of AA persisted in preexisting myotubes via a COX-2-dependent (NS-389-sensitive) pathway, specifically implying dependency on downstream PG biosynthesis. AA-stimulated growth was associated with markedly increased secretion of PGF2αand PGE2; however, incubation of myocytes with PG-rich conditioned medium failed to mimic the effects of direct AA supplementation. In vitro AA supplementation stimulates PG release and skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy via a COX-2-dependent pathway.arachidonic acid(AA) is a polyunsaturated ω-6 fatty acid [20:4(ω6)], present in the diet, that is incorporated into cell membrane phospholipids (PLs) (19). Dietary change elicits rapid alterations in PL fatty acid composition, with supplemental AA increasing plasma PL abundance within days (42). In response to cellular perturbation (e.g., mechanical trauma, cytokines, or growth factors), AA is cleaved from PL molecules via the action of the enzyme PLA2. Free intracellular AA serves as a key transient cell-signaling intermediate, undergoing rapid enzymatic conversion to a diverse array of inflammatory autocrine/paracrine eicosanoid lipid mediators. Parallel cyclooxygenase (COX-1/COX-2) and lipoxygenase (5-LOX/12-LOX/15-LOX) pathways catalyze the oxidation of AA to ultimately produce the PGs (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2, and thromboxane A2) and the leukotriene (LT)/lipoxin (LX) families of eicosanoids, respectively. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are thought to exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic action, specifically by inhibition of the COX branch of the AA pathway, indicative of a central role of PG species in mediating the inflammatory response.Skeletal muscle cells express the COX genes COX-1 and COX-2 (49) and locally synthesize/release AA-derived PGs, including PGD2(56), PGE2/PGF2α(33,40,41,54), and PGI2(2).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate if, in the same subjects, these changes would translate, in vivo, into an enhanced skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. Seven young men were tested (cycle ergometer) during incremental exercises up to voluntary exhaustion and moderate and heavy constant-load exercises (CLE). Measurements were carried out before and after an 8-wk training program by isometric bilateral NMES (quadriceps muscles), which induced an ∼25% increase in maximal isometric force. Breath-by-breath pulmonary O2uptake (V̇o2) and vastus lateralis oxygenation indexes (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined. Skeletal muscle fractional O2extraction was estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy on the basis of changes in concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin + myoglobin. Values obtained at exhaustion were considered “peak” values. The following functional evaluation variables were unaffected by NMES: peak V̇o2; gas exchange threshold; the V̇o2vs. work rate relationship (O2cost of cycling); changes in concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin + myoglobin vs. work rate relationship (related to the matching between O2delivery and V̇o2); peak fractional O2extraction; V̇o2kinetics (during moderate and heavy CLE) and the amplitude of its slow component (during heavy CLE). Thus NMES did not affect several variables of functional evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. Muscle hypertrophy induce"

We here show that, in rat muscles stimulated in vivo under deep anesthesia with identical electrical activity patterns, isometric contractions induced twofold more hypertrophy than contractions with 50–60% of the isometric force. The number of myonuclei and the RNA levels of myogenin and myogenic regulatory factor 4 were increased with high load, suggesting that activation of satellite cells is mechano dependent. On the other hand, training induced a major shift in fiber type distribution from type 2b to 2x that was load independent, indicating that the electrical signaling rather than mechanosignaling controls fiber type. RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase β-1 (S6K1) were not significantly differentially activated by load, suggesting that the differences in mechanical factors were not important for activating the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/S6K1 pathway. The transmembrane molecule syndecan-4 implied in overload hypertrophy in cardiac muscle was not load dependent, suggesting that mechanosignaling in skeletal muscle is different.it is often taken for grantedthat mechanical load is a primary trigger for muscle hypertrophy during strength training and under experimental overload conditions. There is, however, little direct evidence for an effect of mechanical factors per se, the problem being that, in most physiological and experimental models, force development is closely associated with changes in the pattern of action potentials evoked in the muscle. As reviewed previously (15,56,103), evoked electrical activity triggers massive influx and release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and this is known to have profound"

Resistance exercise training (RET) is an effective strategy to overcome muscle mass loss and improve strength, with a stronger effect on type II fibers. In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of a 12-wk progressive RET program on the fiber type-specific skeletal muscle hypertrophic response in older adults. Nineteen subjects [10 men and 9 women (71.1 ± 4.3 yr)] were studied before and after the 12-wk program. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to quantify myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression, cross-sectional area (CSA), satellite cell abundance, myonuclear content, and lipid droplet density. RET induced an increase in MyHC type II fiber frequency and a concomitant decrease in MyHC type I fiber frequency. Mean CSA increased significantly only in MyHC type II fibers (+23.3%,P< 0.05), but myonuclear content increased only in MyHC type I fibers (P< 0.05), with no change in MyHC type II fibers. Satellite cell content increased ~40% in both fiber types (P> 0.05). RET induced adaptations to the capillary supply to satellite cells, with the distance between satellite cells and the nearest capillary increasing in type I fibers and decreasing in type II fibers. Both fiber types showed similar decrements in intramuscular lipid density with training (P< 0.05). Our data provide intriguing evidence for a fiber type-specific response to RET in older adults and suggest flexibilit"

In this report we use microarray and proteomic analyses to identify pathways modulated by LV-aortic banding (AOB) and RV-pulmonary artery banding (PAB) in the immature heart. Newborn New Zealand White rabbits underwent banding of the descending thoracic aorta [LV-AOB;n= 6]. RV-PAB was achieved by banding the pulmonary artery (n= 6). Controls (n= 6 each) were sham-manipulated. After 4 (LV-AOB) and 6 (RV-PAB) wk recovery, the hearts were removed and matched RNA and proteins samples were isolated for microarray and proteomic analysis. Microarray and proteomic data demonstrate that in LV-AOB there is increased transcript expression levels for oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria energy pathways, actin, ILK, hypoxia, calcium, and protein kinase-A signaling and increased protein expression levels of protei"

The primary aim of this study was to examine adaptations to an LL-RET regimen, comparing these to a high-load training regimen (HL-RET). Fourteen resistance-trained males and females (26.4 ± 4.4 yr) participated in a 9-wk RET program (twice per week). Using a within-subject design, each individual trained one leg with HL-RET (3–5 repetitions), and the other with LL-RET (20–25 repetitions), all sets performed to volitional failure. Maximal strength (1 RM) and muscle thickness were assessed. Muscle biopsies were analyzed for fiber type composition, fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), and satellite cell- and myonuclear content using immunofluorescence. The training regimens led to comparable increases in 1 RM in multi-joint movements (21 ± 10%), but not in single-joint movements, where HL-RET was superior (9 ± 13% vs. −3 ± 10%). Regardless of training regimen, muscle thickness increased pre- to postintervention by 7 ± 17% at the mid-thigh site and 8 ± 8% at the distal site. However, this was not accompanied by changes at the myocellular level, with no observed differences in fCSA and fiber type composition. Satellite cell content increased by 25 ± 57% in type I fibers, independent of training regimen, but no changes were noted in myonuclear content. LL-RET can replicate many aspects of HL-RET, leading to similar increases in muscle hypertrophy and strength. Our study supports the notion that comparable adaptations to RET can be achieved using widely distinct loading regimens.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis study compared two distin"

The Journal of Physiology © 2017 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC5663817 PMID:28879684Skeletal myopathy is commonly recognized as a major cause of exercise intolerance in cardiac diseases such as chronic heart failure and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by microvascular rarefaction, fibre type shift toward fatigable type IIb fibre, impaired metabolism and skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction. Skeletal muscle atrophy, an imbalance between protein synthesis and breakdown, is an independent predictor of mortality in cardiac diseases. Exercise training, however, represents a non‐pharmacological treatment that can attenuate or even reverse the process of muscle wasting, by stimulate protein synthesis, angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative effects that are involved with enhancement of performance and improved quality of life. Therefore, a higher fitness level is associated with a lower incidence of skeletal myopathy in cardiac diseases, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its benefits are currently under intense investigation (Bacurauet al.2016).Silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) proteins, sirtuins, which are NAD+‐dependent class III histone deacetylases, are involved in many biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair and cell metabolism. Among all seven sirtuin isoforms (SIRT1–SIRT7), SIRT1 is the best known and most studied. It is reported that SIRT1 regulates muscle development, mass and metabolism. Recently, Kunoet al. (2015) showed reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by use of pharmacological treatment (resveratrol) for cardiomyopathy in mdx mice via SIRT1 activation, and also attenuated skeletal myopathy. These promising results indicate that SIRT1 is able to attenuate signalling pathways associated with muscle wasting and activate targets associated with muscle hypertrophy. In fact, Lee and Goldberg (2013) showed muscle SIRT1 overexpression inhibits atrophy induced by fasting and denervation. SIRT1 activation promoted maintenance of muscle mass by reducing atrogenes, such as forkhead box O 1 (FoxO1) and 3, atrogin1, muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and autophagic signalling.In a recent issue ofThe Journal of Physiology, Koltaiet al. (2017) showed a contribution of SIRT1 to the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. The authors studied functional overload model‐induced plantaris hypertrophy after 2 weeks of muscle ablation, which was SIRT1 dependent. SIRT1 inhibits transcriptional factors, such as FoxO1 and p53; on the other hand, it increases protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐α (PGC‐1α), K63 polyubiquitination, MuRF2, paired box protein 7 (Pax7) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in favour of postnatal muscle growth. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a prominent feature of exercise training regardless of whether skeletal myopathy is present. Overexpression of insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1), a peptide hormone with pleiotropic function, stimulates phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, increasing myofibre size via protein synthesis and myoblast proliferation. The results of Koltaiet al. (2017) indicated that SIRT1 could increase protein synthesis through IGF‐1–AKT signalling and reduce breakdown through FoxO1 deactivation. Indeed, it can activate Pax7‐dependent satellite cells and regenerate the skeletal muscle"

When left untreated, cardiac hypertrophy commonly progresses to heart failure, one of the leading causes of death in the US. A number of studies have shown that reversing cardiac hypertrophy can decrease the progression to heart failure. However, the treatments now used to decrease cardiac hypertrophy have had limited success. Our laboratory has found that the novel muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase named muscle ring-finger-1 (MuRF1) inhibits cardiac hypertrophy and is necessary for its experimental reversal. We have developed transgenic mouse models that have been instrumental in unraveling some of the mechanisms by which MuRF1 inhibits cardiac hypertrophy. We have also identified specific ways in which MuRF1 regulates metabolism at the level of the phosphocreatine shuttle and fatty-acid and glucose metabolism. The knowledge gained from these studies has helped us to understand the processes regulating cardiac hypertrophy, and to identify specific pathways against which to target new therapies that can halt the progression and even possibly reverse the damage associated with cardiac hypertrophy.Cardiac hypertrophy develops most commonly in response to hypertension, and is an independent risk factor for heart failure (1–3). It is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality, whereas reversing cardiac hypertrophy decreases these risks (2–4). The development of cardiac hypertrophy is due to the stimulation of a number of signaling pathways, which activate a handful of transcription factors responsible for the compensatory increase in cardiac muscle mass that occurs in cardiac hypertrophy (5–7). Although tremendous effort has gone into identifying the complex signaling pathways by which cardiac hypertrophy is stimulated, much less work has been aimed at determining ways in which to reverse cardiac hypertrophy, despite the potential therapeutic benefit of doing so. Work in our laboratory has focused on factors that regulate the development of cardiac hypertrophy and are essential in reversing it, specifically the ubiquitin ligase muscle ring-finger-1 (MuRF1). We initially found that MuRF1, a striated muscle-specific protein, inhibits the development of experimentally induced pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes (8). To better understand the role of MuRF1 in regulating cardiac hypertrophy, we created transgenic mice that have either constitutively increased expression of cardiac MuRF1 (MuRF1 Tg mice) or a complete lack of MuRF1 (MuRF1 −/− mice). Our results have shown a surprising role for MuRF1 in regulating both cardiac muscle mass and cardiac energy metabolism.MUSCLE RING-FINGER PROTEINS AND CARDIAC FUNCTIONThe muscle ring-finger (MuRF) family of proteins are striated muscle-specific proteins that have been linked to myogenic responses and various aspects of contractile regulation (9). Three MuRF family members have been identified, and all localize to the M-line and Z-disc of the sarcomere (10–12), supporting the concept that all of them play an important role in the regulation of structure and function of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Although the MuRF proteins share a high degree of structural similarity and are capable of homo- and hetero-dimerization, the functions attributed to each of these proteins are quite different. Muscle ring-finger-1 is vital for the development of skeletal muscle and cardiac atrophy, and has the ability to degrade a number of sarcomeric proteins, including cTnI (13,14), myosin heavy chain (15), and myosin binding protein (16). In contrast, MuRF2 appears to be critical for normal contractile function, general maintenance of muscle structure, and the regulation of developmental cardiac hypertrophy (17), whereas MuRF3 associates with microtubules and plays an important role in muscle development and muscle integrity in myocardial infarction (10,15).Despite the lack of an apparent role of MuRF1 in either muscle maintenan"

It was commissioned by the Editorial Board and reflects the views of the authors.Received 2010 Nov 3; Accepted 2010 Dec 19; Issue date 2011 Apr 1.Journal compilation © 2011 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC3099012 PMID:21173080AbstractAbstractThe transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels is a large family of cation selective ion channels, which are expressed and functional in a variety of tissues. In this review we focus on the most recent results detailing the role of TRP channels in the cardiovascular system. The presented results underscore the role of TRP channels in cardiomyocytes, smooth cells and endothelium, and in disease states such as hypertension, cardiac conduction block and cardiac hypertrophy.Rudi Vennekens(36) is at the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium (KU Leuven). Being a Master in Biochemistry he was fortunate enough to join Bernd Nilius's lab at the Physiology Department of the KU Leuven in 1997, where he studied the likes of volume-regulated anion channels and transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels from an electrophysiologist's point of view. After a post-doc with Profs Veit Flockerzi and Marc Freichel at the University of Saarland in Homburg (Germany) he rejoined the KU Leuven, where he received an independent position in 2008. He is now working in the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research (LICR). His current research is focused on the physiological role of TRP ion channels.The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is large group of ion channel genes, which are related to theDrosophila Trpgene. To date 28 mammalianTrpgenes are known, which are divided into six subfamilies: TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, TRPP and TRPML. All TRP proteins constitute cation channels, but they display a daunting diversity in gating mechanism and cation selectivity. TRP channels can open upon direct ligand binding, G-protein coupled signalling and membrane depolarization. Most TRP channels are Ca2+permeable non-selective cation channels, but exceptions are common: TRPV5 and TRPV6 are highly selective Ca2+channels, TRPM4 and TRPM5 are not Ca2+permeable at all, and TRPM6 and TRPM7 are Mg2+selective cation channels (for recent reviews seeFlockerzi, 2007;Wuet al.2010a).TRPs in endothelium and vascular smooth muscleA role for TRP channels in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle was extensively reviewed recently (Earley, 2006;Guibertet al.2008;Watanabeet al.2008;Di & Malik, 2010;Dietrichet al.2010;Earley, 2010;Earley & Brayden, 2010;Gonzalez-Cobos & Trebak, 2010;Yanget al.2010;Zholos, 2010). In short, TRP channels are involved in endothelial barrier function, release of vasoactive compounds such as nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia sensing and endothelial cell migration. Likewise, in vascular smooth cells various TRP channels have been implicated in Ca2+induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, contraction, hypoxia sensing by pulmonary smooth muscle and stretch or mechanical sensing by vascular smooth muscle cells.Somewhat surprising, in a recent study TRPA1 has been implicated as a player in endothelium-induced vasorelaxation (Earleyet al.2009). Indeed, application of AITC (mustard oil) to precontracted cerebral artery rings induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, not related to nitric oxide release. The mechanism apparently involves activation of K+channels both in endothelium and smooth muscle cells, but how the coupling between both cell types occurs is unclear. It seems counterintuitive that the authors report endothelial expression of TRPA1, because TRPA1 expression until now was detected by several authors almost exclusively in sensory neurons and mechano-sensory epithelial cells of the inner ear (Storyet al.2003;Jordtet al.2004;Kobayashiet al.2005;Nagataet al.2005;Garcia-Anoveros & Nagata, 2007). Whether sensory nerves that innervate endothelium or smooth muscle cells might be involved in mustard oil induced vasorelaxation remains to be determined. It should also be noted that the selectivity of mustard oil for TRPA1 is increasingly being disputed (M. Gees, K. Talaveraet al.perso"

The Journal of Physiology © 2017 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC5330918 PMID:28105708Age‐related loss of skeletal muscle mass leads to reduced strength and impedes the ability to perform daily activities, which ultimately impairs the quality of life. The progressive loss of muscle mass in the elderly mainly results from an imbalance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown. Resistance exercise training (RET) is an effective strategy for stimulating MPS and inducing hypertrophy in young adults. Although RET is beneficial in preventing muscle atrophy in aged subjects, the gain of muscle mass remains limited compared with younger adults. A reduced rate of MPS could explain RET‐induced anabolic resistance in the elderly (see Brooket al.2016for references). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to attenuated muscle hypertrophy in the elderly in response to RET are not clearly understood. A recent study inThe Journal of Physiologyby Brooket al. (2016) has provided novel insights into the signalling pathways involved in age‐related anabolic resistance to RET.Brooket al. investigated the causes of anabolic resistance in old humans subjected to a 6‐week unilateral RET programme consisting of three sessions per week (unilateral knee‐extension exercise; 6 × 8 reps at 75% 1‐RM; Brooket al.2016). The contralateral leg remained untrained and was used as an internal control. Bilateral biopsies from vastus lateralis muscle of 10 healthy active old men (69 years of age) were collected 60–90 min after a single bout of RE, and ∼90 min after a bout of exercise following 3 and 6 weeks of RET. A control group of 10 healthy active young men (23 years of age) were subjected to the same RET programme. Muscle hypertrophy was observed in young, but not in aged subjects after the completion of the RET programme. In addition, the gain of muscle strength was lower in old subjects than in young subjects, in particular for the maximal voluntary contraction. Using the D2O stable isotope tracer technique, Brooket al. evaluated the long‐term MPS during the RET programme. The cumulative rate of MPS (% day−1) and absolute protein synthetic rate (g day−1) were increased in trained muscles of young men from 0 to 3 weeks and over the 6‐week programme, respectively, while no changes were observed in the older group. Then, the signalling pathways involved in the regulation of translational efficiency and translational capacity were investigated. Translational efficiency corresponds to the translational rate per ribosome, which is highly governed by ribosomal activity. Translational capacity is determined by the amount of translational machinery per cell, which mainly includes ribosomes, tRNAs and accessory factors.To evaluate the translational efficiency, Brooket al. (2016) determined the phosphorylation levels of mTORC1 and of its downstream targets P70S6K1, RPS6, 4E‐BP1 and eEF2, which are involved in translational initiation and elongation. Among these factors, only the phosphorylation of P70S6K1 and RPS6 increased after the first bout of exercise in young men, while only RPS6 phosphorylation increased in the elderly after this acute exercise. Furthermore, none of these proteins was activated in the young or old groups after an exercise bout following 3 or 6 weeks of RET. This refractory phenomenon was suggested to explain the reduced rate of hypertrophy with training progression. Since the age‐related impairment in P70S6K1 activation was independent of the other signalling proteins described above, the authors concluded that a reduced translational efficiency cannot entirely cause the blunted muscle hypertrophic response in the elderly.Ribosome biogenesis has recently emerged as a cellular process for increasing translational capacity and protein synthesis in response to high contractile activity. This complex process requires the coordinated action of the three types of RNA polymerases (RNA Pol I, II and III). RNA Pol I is responsible for rDNA transcription, which forms 45S pre‐rRNA in the nucleolus. This pre‐rRNA is then spliced into 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA. 5S rRNA and tRNA are transcribed by RNA Pol III in the nucleoplasm while the transcription of genes encoding the ribosomal proteins (RP) genes is mediated by RNA Pol II. Brooket al. (2016) examined the mRNA expression of six RP genes and the content of total RNA. Except for a moderat"

However, the transcriptional profiles triggered by mechanical stretch in cardiac myocytes are not fully understood. Here, we performed the first genome-wide time series study of gene expression changes in stretched cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM)s, resulting in 205, 579, 737, 621, and 1542 differentially expressed (>2-fold, P < 0.05) genes in response to 1, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours of cyclic mechanical stretch. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to predict functional pathways and upstream regulators of differentially expressed genes in order to identify regulatory networks that may lead to mechanical stretch induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes. We also performed micro (miRNA) expression profiling of stretched NRVMs, and identified that a total of 8 and 87 miRNAs were significantly (P < 0.05) altered by 1–12 and 24–48 hours of mechanical stretch, respectively. Finally, through integration of miRNA and mRNA data, we predicted the miRNAs that regulate mRNAs potentially leading to the hypertrophic growth induced by mechanical stretch. These analyses predicted nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2) and interferon regulatory transcription factors as well as the let-7 family of miRNAs as playing roles in the regulation of stretch-regulated genes in cardiomyocytes.IntroductionCardiac hypertrophy provides an adaptive mechanism to maintain cardiac output in response to increased workload, such as occurs in diseases such as chronic hypertension or myocardial infarction. In the early stages of pathological hypertrophy, changes in cardiac structure compensate for the increased load, whereas in later stages, excessive hypertrophic growth results in decompensation and heart failure1,2. As cardiac myocytes are generally considered to be terminally differentiated cells3, cardiac hypertrophy has been considered to involve an increase in the size of individual cardiomyocytes. Hypertrophy is associated with alterations in the structure of the heart referred to as myocardial remodeling; in the late-phase, this includes increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, perturbations of cellular calcium homeostasis and an increased rate of cardiac myocyte apoptosis4,5.Hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes is triggered by mechanical stimuli as well as the neurohumoral activation produced by cardiac overload. At the level of individual cardiac myocytes, the hypertrophic response is characterized not only by an increase in cell size, but also by an accumul"

However, the effect of myocardial reverse remodeling on cardiac mechanoenergetics has not been elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to provide a detailed hemodynamic characterization in a rat model of LVH undergoing pressure unloading. Pressure overload was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by abdominal aortic banding for 6 (AB 6th wk) or 12 wk (AB 12th wk). Sham-operated animals served as controls. Aortic debanding procedure was performed after the 6th experimental week (debanded 12th wk) to investigate the regression of LVH. Pressure unloading resulted in significant reduction of LVH (heart weight-to-tibial length ratio: 0.38 ± 0.01 vs. 0.58 ± 0.02 g/mm, cardiomyocyte diameter: 18.3 ± 0.1 vs. 24.1 ± 0.8 μm debanded 12th wk vs. AB 12th wk,P< 0.05), attenuated the extracellular matrix remodeling (Masson's score: 1.37 ± 0.13 vs. 1.73 ± 0.10, debanded 12th wk vs. AB 12th wk,P< 0.05), provided protection against the diastolic dysfunction, and reversed the maladaptive contractility augmentation (slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship: 1.39 ± 0.24 vs. 2.04 ± 0.09 mmHg/μl,P< 0.05 debanded 12th wk "

It is also common in individuals with spinal cord injury due to repetitive movements during wheelchair use. Although it is well known that prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome is high in individuals with spinal cord injury, no previous study identified aberrant muscle as the cause.Case presentationA 43-year-old man with T10 incomplete, ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) C, patient with paraplegia who is a wheelchair basketball player presented to our electrodiagnostic laboratory with complaints of bilateral hand numbness after intensive training for a local veteran wheelchair basketball tournament. Nerve conduction studies showed carpal tunnel syndrome. Ultrasonographic assessment of carpal tunnel revealed the presence of abnormal muscle in the carpal tunnel encroaching the median nerve dynamically.DiscussionIt is important to identify the underlying cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a common cause of upper extremity impairment in individuals with spinal cord injury because individuals with spinal cord injury who use wheelchair depend on their arms for mobility, transfers, and most activities of daily life.Subject terms:Spinal cord diseases, PathogenesisIntroductionCarpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most commonly encountered peripheral neuropathies in the upper extremity; it is defined as an entrapment syndrome of the median nerve at the wrist [1]. While most cases are idiopathic, several extrinsic or intrinsic processes are responsible for the etiology of carpal tunnel syndrome; some of these processes are common while others are rare [2,3]. While the carpal tunnel is thought to only contain tendons, ultrasound imaging shows that it might contain echogenic muscle bellies in addition to other components of the carpal tunnel. These aberrant structures most often appear as elongated, hypertrophic normal muscle bellies, which intrude into tunnel [4]. There is a lack of literature describing the ultrasonographic occurrence of aberrant muscle bellies in carpal tunnel, while other anatomical variations, such as bifurcated median nerves and persistent median arteries, have been previously reported several times [4]. In patients with an aberrant muscle belly in the carpal tunnel, the tunnel becomes more crowded, which can lead to entrapment of the median nerve. Few studies have reported on the abnormal appearance of the palmaris longus, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the lumbrical muscles, or aberrant muscles, such as the palmaris profundus and the accessory palmaris longus. Hypertrophy of these muscles that cause carpal tunnel syndrome have been demonstrated in manual laborers [2]. In this paper, we present a case of carpal tunnel syndrome due to hypertrophy of the flexor digitorum superficialis of index finger in a patient with spinal cord injury who is a wheelchair basketball player.Case presentationA 43-year-old man with T10 incomplete, ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) C, patient with paraplegia who is a wheelchair basketball player presented to our electrodiagnostic laboratory with complaints of bilateral hand numbness after intensive training for a local veteran wheelchair basketball tournament. Previously, the patient had undergone carpal tunnel release but he reported that he did not gain complete relief from symptoms. Motor nerve conduction studies of the median nerve revealed evident prolonged distal latency. Right sensory nerve conduction study showed prolonged latency and delayed conduction velocity while left median sensory nerve action potential could not be elicited. The nerve conduction study findings were compatible to right-sided moderat"

The mice in the EHP groups were subjected to 3 weeks of swimming training, and in the bisoprolol groups, bisoprolol was administered by gavage once daily from two days before till the end of the training. One week after the training, TAC or sham surgery was performed. Echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements were performed to evaluate cardiac function of the mice, and the myocardial tissues were examined histologically to detect cardiac remodeling.ResultsCompared with the sedentary group, the mice"

The basal levels of mitotically active and quiescent satellite cell (−46 and −39% vs. +/+, and −40 and −30% vs. +/op) and myonuclear number (−29% vs. +/+ and −28% vs. +/op) in fibers ofop/opmice were significantly less than controls. Fiber length and sarcomere number inop/opwere also less than +/+ (−22%) and +/op(−21%) mice. Similar trend was noted in fiber cross-sectional area (CSA, −15% vs. +/+,P= 0.06, and −14% vs. +/op,P= 0.07). The sizes of myonuclear domain, cytoplasmic volume per myonucleus, were identical in all types of mice. The CSA, length, and the whole number of sarcomeres, myonuclei, and mitotically active and quiescent satellite cells, as well as myonuclear domain, in single muscle fibers were decreased after 10 days of unloading in all types of mice, although all of these parameters in +/+ and +/opmice were increased toward the control values after 10 days of reloading. However, none of these levels inop/opmice were recovered. Data suggest that M-CSF and/or macrophages are important to activate satellite cells, which cause increase of myonuclear number during fiber hypertrophy. However, it is unclear why their responses to general growth and reloading after unloading are different.skeletal muscles are composedof multinucleated muscle fibers and have an extensive "

Among the topics covered in the course is the cellular and molecular basis of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The reading list for the course includes many of what I believe to be classic articles on cardiac myocyte growth. Among the articles that have strongly influenced our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of the pathology are 3 that were published by Dr Paul Simpson inCirculation Researchin 19821,2and 1985.3I became aware of these articles when they were published because my laboratory was examining the secretion of endocrine and paracrine factors by the heart, and our focus was on the peptide hormone, atrial natriuretic factor. In part, our studies required that we prepare separate cultures of rat atrial and ventricular myocytes, and that we maintain them in serum-free medium to test the effects of various adrenergic agonists on atrial natriuretic factor expression, post-translational processing, and secretion. Thankfully, the articles of Paul Simpson described with clarity and completeness how to not only isolate neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, but also how to maintain them in serum-free medium. Perhaps most remarkable to those of us studying mechanisms of cardiac myocyte function was the description of the growth effects of adrenergic agonists on cultured cardiac myocytes.I decided to highlight these 3 articles in this installment ofCirculation ResearchClassics because the techniques described in them are timeless mainstays in the technology toolbox of molecular cardiology research laboratories around the world, and because the results reported in them have had such great effect on the field. In addition to providing essential methodological detail, these articles report the results in a complete and convincing manner. Additional features of the articles that have contributed to their enduring, transformative nature include the following conclusions:1.One can and must control the type, quantity, and density of the cells cultured from the neonatal rat heart to obtain valid, meaningful results.2.The media components must be defined, and their composition and quality must be consistent.3.The volume of media used in cultures can profoundly affect the results and, therefore, must be carefully considered and then made consistent.4.Experiments must be designed and performed with keen attention to detail and with a vision on the applicability of the results to the physiology and pathology under study.Together, these classics have been cited >1300×. Moreover, the number of articles published subsequently in which the search phrase cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes appears has dramatically and continually increased from the mid 1980s, when these classics were published, to 2003, after which the citation rate has leveled (Figure 1). This citation pattern underscores the continued importance of the neonatal rat cultured heart cell model system in molecular cardiology research. I found that these articles serve as ideal starting points for teaching students about research on pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In fact, they are the first 3 articles assigned in my class, the first section of which is entitled Cardiac Hypertrophy 101.Figure 1.Cultured"

Overloading the right ventricle results in right ventricular hypertrophy, which progresses to failure in a process characterized by impaired Ca2+dynamics and force production that is linked with transverse (t)-tubule remodeling. This also unloads the left ventricle, which consequently atrophies. Experimental left-ventricular unloading can result in t-tubule remodeling, but it is currently unclear if this occurs in right-sided heart failure. In this work, we used a model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced right heart failure in male rats, using confocal microscopy to investigate cellular remodeling of t-tubules, junctophilin-2 (JPH2), and ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2). We examined remodeling across tissue anatomical regions of both ventricles: in trabeculae, papillary muscles, and free walls. Our analyses revealed that MCT hearts demonstrated a significant loss of t-tubule periodicity, disruption of the normal sarcomere striated pattern with JPH2 labeling, and also a disorganized striated pattern of RyR2, a feature not previously reported in right heart failure. Remodeling of JPH2 and RyR2 in the MCT heart was more pronounced in papillary muscles and trabeculae compared with free walls, particularly in the left ventricle. We find that these structures, commonly used as ex vivo muscle preparations, are more sensitive to the disease process.NEW & NOTEWORTHYIn this work, we demonstrate that t-tubule remodeling occurs in the atrophied left ventricle as well as the overloaded right ventricle after right-side heart failure. Moreover, we identify that t-tubule remodeling in both ventricles is linked to sarcoplasmic reticulum remodeling as indicated by decreased labeling periodicity of both the Ca2+release channel, RyR2, and the cardiac junction-forming protein, JPH2, that forms a link between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma. Studies developing treatments for right-sided heart failure should consider effects on both the right and left ventricle.INTRODUCTIONT-tubule remodeling and impaired Ca2+handling are prominent features in the right ventricle (RV) of pulmonary arterial hypertension (1,2). T-tubules are plasma membrane invaginations, ∼200 nm in diameter in rats, that penetrate deep within the myocyte, where they facilitate a rapid cell-wide depolarization that initiates synchronous Ca2+release (3). Loss of contractile function in heart failure (HF) is linked with remodeled t-tubules via dyssynchrony of Ca2+cycling (4). Attached to its membrane is junctophilin"

Patients underwent TMJ MRI with a 1.5-T system in open and closed mouth positions. The masseter and temporalis muscles were measured in the axial plane when the patient’s mouth was closed.Results:At its thinnest, the disc averaged was 1.11±0.24 mm. At their thickest, the masseter averaged was 13.65±2.19 mm and temporalis muscles was 12.98±2.4 mm. Of the discs, 24% were positioned normally, 74% were positioned anteriorly, and 2% were positioned posteriorly. The temporalis muscle was significantly thicker in patients with normally positioned discs than in those with anteriorly positioned discs (p=0.035).Conclusions:The temporalis muscle was significantly thicker in patients with normally positioned discs than in those with anteriorly positioned discs (p=0.035). Additional studies should be conducted to evaluate the relationships between all masticatory and surrounding muscles and disc movements in patients with bruxism.The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a special joint that forms the synovial articulation between the temporal bone and lower mandible bilaterally.1,2A biconcave fibrocartilage articular disc divides the TMJ into superior and inferior compartments.3The articular disc in the TMJ is postulated to behave as a shock absorber and to distribute the joint load.4,5However, the effects of certain support of the articular disc on the mechanics of the TMJ are not understood clearly.3,5Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) affect the stomatognathic system. The masticatory muscles and TMJ are the most affected structures.6,7Temporomandibular disorders may be associated with neuromuscular, anatomical, and psychological factors. Limitation of physiological activity, joint sounds such as clicking, muscle and joint sensitivity or pain, and limitation and deviation of mandibular movements are the main signs and symptoms of TMDs. Headaches and neck and ear symptoms may also be seen in these patients.8,9Disc displacement is a change in disc location from its normal position on top of the man"

We describe an unusual case presenting with thenar hypertrophy.A 52 year-old, right-handed man presented with 10 years of intermittent paresthesias in the left median nerve distribution and difficulty snapping the fingers. Driving and typing worsened his symptoms. His examination revealed increased thenar bulk without focal masses (Fig. 1A). A Tinel sign was present. Sensory exam did not elicit significant abnormalities. Mild thenar weakness was noted. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed prolonged distal motor latency (7.9 ms), decreased compound motor action potential amplitude compared to the right (left 5.1 mV, right 9.2 mV) and absent left median sensory nerve action potential. Ulnar studies and F-wave latencies were normal. Needle EMG of abductor pollicis brevis showed increased insertional activity, 1+ fibrillation potentials, 2+ positive sharp waves, 3+ fasciculation potentials, increased motor unit potential (MUP) amplitude, reduced MUP recruitment and increased firing rate. Studies were consistent with left focal median neuropathy at the wrist.Figure 1.Open in a new tabA) Thenar eminence in the symptomatic left hand is appreciably larger compared to the right. B) MR axial T1 weighted non-fat saturated image reveals linear strands of hyperintense fat (arrow) infiltrating the thenar muscles. C) MR axial fat saturated T2 weighted pre-operative image reveals a globular mass within the median nerve with a “cable-like” (arrow) appearance measuring 1.6 × 1.2 cm. D) MR axial fat saturated T2 weighted post-operative image revealing a globular mass within the median nerve with a “cable-like” appearance without significant change in size (arrow).To further elucidate the etiology of thenar hypertrophy, MRI of the hand and wrist was performed to assess structural detail. MRI revealed linear strands of fat infiltrating thenar muscles (Fig. 1B), which was different from diffuse fibrofatty change associated with advanced muscle atrophy. There was globular enlargement of the median nerve with linear cable-like appearance of the nerve fascicles with surrounding fat. The enlargement measured 1.2 × 1.6 centimeters and was consistent with lipofibromatous hamartoma (LFH) (Fig. 1C).He underwent decompression of the nerve. Nerve enlargement and swelling was noted at the time surgery but fibrofatty change was not appreciated because of intact epineurium. Three months post-operatively, paresthesias improved. However, imaging revealed no change in the size of the median nerve mass (Fig. 1D).This case is instructive because thenar hypertrophy led to imaging, which revealed LFH. Thenar hypertrophy could result from either pseudohypertrophy or true hypertrophy related to spontaneous activity, increased work of remaining fibers, and fiber stretching2,3. Chronic denervation and spontaneous activity on needle EMG raises the possibility of true thenar hypertrophy. The focal, band-like pattern of fatty infiltration in thenar muscles suggests extension of LFH. If the fatty replacement were due to severe muscle atrophy, then significant clinical weakness and diffuse fibrofatty change should be pre"

Acute post-exercise serum growth hormone (GH), free testosterone (fT), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and cortisol responses were determined following an acute intense leg resistance exercise routine at the midpoint of a 12-week resistance exercise training study. Acute hormonal responses were correlated with gains in lean body mass (LBM), muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and leg press strength. There were no significant correlations between the exercise-induced elevations (area under the curve—AUC) of GH, fT and IGF-1 and gains in LBM or leg press strength. Significant correlations were found for cortisol, usually assumed to be a hormone indicative of catabolic drive, AUC with change in LBM (r= 0.29,P< 0.05) and type II fibre CSA (r= 0.35,P< 0.01) as well as GH AUC and gain in fibre area (type I:r= 0.36,P= 0.006; type II:r= 0.28,P= 0.04, but not lean mass). No correlations with strength were observed. We report that the acute exercise-induced systemic hormonal responses of cortisol and GH are weakly correlated with resistance training-induced changes in fibre CSA and LBM (cortisol only), but not with changes in strength.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00421-011-2246-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords:Hypertrophy, Training program, Muscle mass, Testosterone, Growth hormone, CortisolIntroductionProtein accretion leading to hypertrophy with resistance training is the result of accumulated periods of positive muscle protein balance as a result of the synergistic stimulation of rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) by feeding and exercise (Burd et al.2009; Phillips2004; Phillips et al.2009). Nutritional and contractile variables influence changes in MPS and hypertrophy (Phillips2004; Phillips et al.2009). For example, the type of protein consumed after resistance exercise can determine the acute amplitude of MPS and lean mass gains (Cribb et al.2006; Hartman et al.2007; Tang et al.2009). Different exercise programs can result in differential responses of MPS after resistance exercise (Burd et al.2010; Moore et al.2005). Previously, we reported that milk consumption after resistance exercise performed over 12 weeks resulted in greater increases in muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and lean body mass (LBM) than consumption of an equivalent amount of soy protein or isoenergetic carbohydrate drink (Hartman et al.2007). Interestingly, despite the overall group differences we still observed, as is common (Bamman et al.2007; Petrella et al.2006,2008), a high degree of heterogeneity in phenotypic response of gain in LBM, fibre CSA as well as strength. That is, certain individuals ‘responded’ to the resistance training stimulus by exhibiting gains in strength and muscle mass that were sustantially greater than the group mean response despite differences between the groups’ post-exercise nutrition. Thus, in addition to immediate post-exercise nutrition, other factors are clearly contributing to the phenotypic response to resistance training.Recently, responses of microRNA expression (Davidsen et al.2010), p70S6K1 phosphorylation (Kumar et al.2009; Terzis et al.2008), satellite cell activation and myonuclear addition (Petrella et al.2008) have been highlighted as exhibiting differentiated responses to resistance training in responders and non-responders. There are also reports (Ahtiainen et al.2003a; McCall et al.1999) that the acute growth hormone and testosterone response may also be associated wi"

However, how RAS activation causes cardiac lesions remains elusive. Here we report the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this process. In rats with chronic infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II), eight Wnt ligands were induced and β-catenin activated in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by small molecule inhibitor ICG-001 restrained Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by normalizing heart size and inhibiting hypertrophic marker genes. ICG-001 also attenuated myocardial fibrosis and inhibited α-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and collagen I expression. These changes were accompanied by a reduced expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide. Interestingly, ICG-001 also lowered blood pressure induced by Ang II.In vitro, Ang II induced multiple Wnt ligands and activated β-catenin in rat primary cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. ICG-001 inhibited myocyte hypertrophy and Snail1, c-Myc and atrial natriuretic peptide expression, and abolished the fibrogenic effect of Ang II in cardiac fibroblasts. Finally, recombinant Wnt3a was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte injury and fibroblast activationin vitro. Taken together, these results illustrate an essential role for Wnt/β-catenin in mediating hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Therefore, blockade of this pathway may be a novel strategy for ameliora"

Thirty-eight untrained males (21 ± 3 yr) participated in whole body resistance training (10 wk, 2 × weekly). Participants completed testing [ultrasound, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)] and donated a vastus lateralis (VL) biopsy 1 wk before training and 72 h following the last training bout. Higher responders (HR,n= 10) and lower responders (LR,n= 10) were stratified based on a composite score considering changes in pQCT-derived mid-thigh cross-sectional area (mCSA), ultrasound-derived VL thickness, and mean fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA). In all participants, training reduced matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-14 protein (P< 0.001) and increased satellite cell abundance (P< 0.001); however, VL fascial thickness, ECM protein content per myofiber, MMP-2/-9 protein content, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1/-2 protein content, collagen-1/-4 protein content, macrophage abundance, or fibroadipogenic progenitor cell abundance were not altered. Regarding responder analysis, MMP-14 exhibited an interaction (P= 0.007), and post hoc analysis revealed higher protein content in HR versus LR before training (P= 0.026) and a significant decrease from pre to posttraining in HR only (P= 0.002). In summary, basal skeletal muscle ECM markers are minimally affected with 10 wk of resistance training, and these findings could be related to not capturing more dynamic alterations in the assayed markers earlier in training. However, the downregulation in MMP-14 in college-aged men classified as HR is a novel finding and warrants continued investigation, and further research is needed to delineate muscle connective tissue strength attributes between HR and LR.NEW & NOTEWORTHYAlthough past studies have examined aspects of "

We previously showed that cardiac‐specific expression of β3‐AR inhibits the hypertrophic response to neurohormonal stimulation. Here, we further analysed signalling pathways involved in the anti‐hypertrophic effect of β3‐AR.Methods and resultsIn vitrohypertrophic responses to phenylephrine (PE) were analysed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the human β3‐AR (AdVhβ3). We confirmed results in mice with cardiomyocyte‐specific moderate expression of human β3‐AR (β3‐TG) and wild‐type (WT) littermates submitted to thoracic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 9 weeks. We observed a colocalization of β3‐AR with the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) both in neonatal rat and in adult mouse cardiomyocytes. Treatment of NRVM with PE in"

We sought to determine if preoperative pyloric measurements correlated with weight and age in patients with surgically proven HPS.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted of 189 patients with HPS treated at a single institution over a 5-year period (2005 to 2010). Pearson correlation and linear regression analyses were used to determine if there were statistically significant associations between these combinations of factors: age and pyloric muscle thickness, weight and pyloric muscle thickness, age and pyloric length, and weight and pyloric length.Results:Patients' mean age was 4.6 weeks (range, 1 to 17 weeks). Their mean weight was 3.9 kg (range, 2.5 to 8.0 kg). Mean pyloric muscle thickness was 0.42 cm (range, 0.18 to 0.86 cm), and mean pyloric length was 1.89 cm (range, 0.8 to 2.8 cm). Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed a significant relationship between age and muscle thickness (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) as well as weight and muscle thickness (r = 0.24, p = 0.001). No significant relationship existed between pyloric length and age or weight. Linear regression analysis demonstrated similar results.Conclusion:In patients with HPS, pyloric muscle thickness was directly related to age and weight. Practitioners should be aware that smaller and younger infants with a clinical diagnosis of HPS may still truly have HPS even though the minimum diagnostic criterion for muscle thickness or length is not found on ultrasound.IntroductionThe current generally accepted ultrasound guidelines for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) arise from work done by Rohrschneider et al.1They found that pathologic limits were 3 mm for pyloric muscle thickness, 15 mm for pyloric length, 11 mm for pyloric diameter, and 12 mL for pyloric volume. Additionally, they concluded that muscle thickness was the most discriminating factor. However, clinical experience has led us to question the applicability of these findings to infants of varying ages and weights.We postulated that infants with smaller weights and/or ages who had HPS may have had pyloric measurements that were within the normal accepted range (ie, measurements that by current standards are not diagnostic of HPS). This study was aimed at determining whether preoperative pyloric measurements correlated with weight and age in patients with surgically proven HPS.MethodsThe study design was a retrospective chart review. The institutional review board at our institution approved this study. Data from a single institution over a five-year period (2005 to 2020) were reviewed. Patients were identified by diagnosis codes indicating that they had HPS. Operative reports were reviewed to verify the diagnosis. Demographic data on admission for surgery were collected about individual patients. These included sex, age (postgestational age in weeks), weight (in kilograms), and duration of hospital admission. The muscle wall thickness and length of the pyloric channel (both in centimeters), as documented on the ultrasound report, were obtained for each patient. Patients who did not have pyloric ultrasound measurements recorded or who did not have pyloric stenosis at the time of operation were excluded.Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine if there were statistically significant associations between the following combinations of factors: patient age and pyloric muscle thickness, patient weight and pyloric muscle thickness, age and pyloric length, and weight and pyloric length.

In this study, skeletal myofiber vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was hypothesized to regulate hypertrophy, capillarity, and contractile function in response to functional overload (FO). Adult myofiber-specific VEGF gene-ablated mice (skmVEGF−/−) and wild-type (WT) littermates underwent plantaris FO or sham surgery (SHAM). Mass, morphology, in vivo function, IGF-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Akt were measured at 7, 14, and 30 days. FO resulted in hypertrophy in both genotypes, but fiber sizes were 13% and 23% smaller after 14 and 30 days, respectively, and mass 15% less after 30 days in skmVEGF−/−than WT. FO increased isometric force after 30 days in WT and decreased in skmVEGF−/−after 7 and 14 days. FO also resulted in a reduction in specific force and this differed between genotypes at 14 days. Fatigue resistance improved only in 14-day WT mice. Capillary density was decreased by FO in both genotypes. However, capillary-to-fiber ratios were 19% and 15% lower in skmVEGF−/−than WT at the 14- and 30-day time points, respectively. IGF-1 was increased by FO at all time points and was 45% and 40% greater in skmVEGF−/−than WT after 7 and 14 days, respectively. bFGF, HGF, total Akt, and phospho-Akt, independent of VEGF expression, and VEGF levels in WT were increased after 7 days of FO. These findings suggest VEGF-dependent capillary maintenance supports muscle growth and function in overloaded muscle and is not rescued by compensatory IGF-1 expression.skeletal musclenormally responds to chronic elevations in load by increasing mass, strength, and/or fatigue resistance (46). However, inadequate responses can lead to muscle dysfunction and weakness, resulting in a muscle that cannot meet the demands necessary for normal mobility. Loading-induced impairment in muscle function can occur with aging or as a result of several chronic diseases characterized by muscle wasting or cachexia (6,26,41). Under these conditions smaller and weaker muscles often do not have the capacity to perform normal locomotor activities. Hypertrophy induced by functional overload (FO) of the plantaris provides an in vivo model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which an increase in muscle mass and improved function occur in response to increased contractile demands in healthy muscle or is compromised in models of disease.While it is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an essential angiogenic factor for skeletal muscle development (22), it also plays a role in maintaining capillaries "

    "content": "AbstractStress-induced hypertrophic growth of the heart predisposes the heart to arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction, and clinical heart failure. FHL2 (four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2) is expressed predominantly in the heart, and inactivation of the gene coding for FHL2 leads to exaggerated responsiveness to adrenergic stress. Activation of calcineurin occurs downstream of β-adrenergic signaling and is required for isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that FHL2 suppresses stress-induced activation of calcineurin. FHL2 is upregulated in mouse hearts exposed to isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist, and isoproterenol-induced increases in the NFAT target genes RCAN1.4 and BNP were amplified significantly in FHL2 knockout (FHL2−/−) mice compared with levels in wild-type (WT) mice. To determine whether the effect of FHL2 on NFAT target gene transcript levels occurred at the level of transcription, HEK 293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct harboring the NFAT-dependent promoters of either RCAN1 or interleukin 2 (IL-2). Consistent with thein vivodata, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of FHL2 led to increased activation of these promoters by constitutively active calcineurin or the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Importantly, activation of the RCAN1 promoter by ionomycin, in control and FHL2 knockdown cells, was abolished by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine, confirming the calcineurin dependence of the response. Overexpression of FHL2 inhibited activation of both NFAT reporter constructs. Furthermore, NRVMs overexpressing FHL2 exhibited reduced hypertrophic growth in response to constitutively active calcineurin, as measured by cell cross-sectional area and fetal gene expression. Finally, immunostaining in isolated adult cardiomyocytes revealed colocalization of FHL2 and calcineurin predominantly at the sarcomere and activation of calcineurin by endothelin-1-facilitated interaction between FHL2 and calcineurin. FHL2 is an endogenous, agonist-dependent suppressor of calcineurin.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank members of the Hill lab for constructive comments and support.We had full access to, and take full responsibility for, the integrity of these data.

In vivo studies have suggested that the timing of systolic stretch can affect regional tension and external work development. In the present study, we measured the direct effects of systolic stretch timing on the magnitude of tension and external work development in isolated murine right ventricular papillary muscles. A servomotor was used to impose precisely timed stretches relative to electrical activation while a force transducer measured force output and strain was monitored using a charge-couple device camera and topical markers. Stretches taking place during peak intracellular Ca2+statistically increased peak tension up to 270%, whereas external work due to stretches in this interval reached values of 500 J/m. An experimental analysis showed that time-varying elastance overestimated peak tension by 100% for stretches occurring after peak isometric tension. The addition of the force-velocity relation explained some effects of stretches occurring before the peak of the Ca2+transient but had no effect in later stretches. An estimate of transient deactivation was measured by performing quick stretches to dissociate cross-bridges. The timing of transient deactivation explained the remaining differences between the model and experiment. These results suggest that stretch near the start of cardiac tension development substantially increases twitch tension and mechanical work production, whereas late stretches decrease external work. While the increased work can mostly be explained by the time-varying elastance of cardiac muscle, the decreased work in muscles stretched after the peak of the Ca2+transient is largely due to myofilament deactivation.dyssynchronous electrical activationof the ventricles, due to conduction defects such as left bundle branch block or ventricular pacing of structurally normal hearts, leads to abnormal systolic stretch (2). During ectopic ventricular pacing, early contraction near the pacing site stretches remote sites that have not yet begun to contract (17). Transient stretching of late-activated regions has been referred to as “prestretch” (1,5,12) and can reach magnitudes of up to 20% (20). Conversely, early activated sites shorten prematurely and stretch during ejection (8). Dyssynchronous activation due to ventricular pacing of the normal heart also results in regionally heterogeneous distributions of local myocardial work (4,13), O2uptake, myocardial blood flow (4) and, if sustained, asymmetric hypertrophy (19).Because "

To date, familial LGMD2L was reported in European countries and had not been reported in China.A careful investigation of the clinical manifestations, muscle performance imaging, biopsy, and target next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was utilized to identify pathogenic genetic variants in a 4-generation pedigree that includes 6 affected individuals.The results revealed mild-to-moderate hypertrophy of bilateral gastrocnemii and slight weakness and atrophy in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs, with obviously increased serum creatine kinase levels. The symptoms were more serious in the male proband but were also observed in females. Obvious and symmetric atrophy and fat infiltration of posterior segments of the thigh was evident in muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pathological changes included a small amount of atrophic and hypertrophic fibers, scattered necrotizing fibers, a small number of increased nuclei, inward migration, mild proliferation of interstitial connective tissue, and no inflammatory cell infiltration. The pathogenic allele was a c.220C > T mutation in the anoctamin 5 (ANO5) gene.The LGMD2L family was characterized by mild chronic myopathy and bilateral gastrocnemius hypertrophy with obviously increased CK levels. Pathological changes included atrophy of fibers with interstitial connective tissues hyperplasia. The pathogenic allele was a c.220C> T mutation in the ANO5 gene.Keywords:ANO5, anoctamin 5, LGMD2L, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2L, muscular dystrophy, next-generation sequencing1. IntroductionAnoctaminopathies are a group of autosomal recessive skeletal muscle disorders with various clinical phenotypes, caused by the abnormal expression of anoctamin 5 (ANO5) protein due to ANO5 gene mutations, mainly divided into 3 clinical phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2L (LGMD2L), Miyoshi phenotype of distal muscular dystrophy 3 (MMD3) and asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia.[1]LGMD2L is the most common phenotype of anoctaminopathy, mainly characterized by late adult onset, slowly progressing asymmetric weakness and atrophy of proximal muscles, accompanied by increased creatine kinase (CK) levels, dystrophic pathological changes and electromyography (EMG) showing myogenic damage.[2]To date, the diagnosis mainly depends on genet"

The approach can be used to investigate possible structural changes occurring in myosin of fiber s altered by diseases and aging. In this work, we labeled myosin at position Cys707, located in the SH1-SH2 helix in the myosin head cleft, with iodoacetamide spin label, a spin label that is sensitive to the reorientational motion of this protein during the ATPase cycle and characterized the biochemical states of the labeled myosin head by means of continuous wave EPR. After checking the sensitivity and the power of the technique on different muscles and species, we investigated whether changes in the fraction of strongly bound myosin heads might explain the contractile alterations observed in atrophic and hypertrophic murine muscles. In both conditions, the difference in contractile force could not be justified simply by the difference in muscle mass. Our results showed that in atrophic muscles the decrease in force generation was attributable to a lower fraction of strongly bound cross bridges during maximal activation. In contrast in hypertrophic muscles, the increase in force generation was likely due to several factors, as pointed out by the comparison of the EPR experiments with the tension measurements on single skinned fibers.INTRODUCTIONSkeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue, as its fibers can change their size and their functional properties to perform new tasks or respond to new conditions (for a review, see Ref.6). The adaptive changes of muscle fibers occur in response to variations in the pattern of neural stimulation, loading conditions, availability of substrates, and hormonal signals. In response to increased functional demands, skeletal muscle fibers can increase their size (hypertrophy), while reduced activity leads to a decrease of cellular volume (atrophy). Although, as general rule, the ability to generate force during contraction varies in proportion to muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) ("

Side scatter by flow cytometry in the same cells was validated as an index of myocyte size. β-MyHC-positive myocytes constituted 3±1% of myocytes in control hearts (n=12), increasing to 25±10% at 3 days to 6 weeks after TAC (n=24,P<0.01). β-MyHC-positive myocytes did not enlarge with TAC and were smaller at all times than myocytes without β-MyHC (≈70% as large,P<0.001). β-MyHC-positive myocytes arose by addition of β-MyHC to α-MyHC and had more total MyHC after TAC than did the hypertrophied myocytes that had α-MyHC only. Myocytes positive for β-MyHC were found in discrete regions of the left ventricle in 3 patterns: perivascular, in areas with fibrosis, and in apparently normal myocardium.Conclusions:β-MyHC protein is induced by pressure overload in a minor subpopulation of smaller cardiac myocytes. The hypertrophied myocytes after TAC have α-MyHC only. These data challenge the current paradigm of the fetal hypertrophic gene program and identify a new subpopulation of smaller working ventricular myocytes with more myosin.IntroductionIn 1979, Lompre et al1described the appearance in rat cardiac overload of a V3 myosin isoenzyme with reduced ATPase activity and slower mobility on nondenaturing gels. V3 myosin contains β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC), whereas the normal adult V1 myosin with higher ATPase activity contains α-MyHC, and protein changes are caused by changes in the mRNAs.2–4In rats and mice, β-MyHC mRNA and protein are induced reliably by disease-related hypertrophic stimuli in vivo and by hypertrophic agonists in culture3–5but not by physiological stimuli such as exercise training.6Thus, β-MyHC has become the classic marker for pathological hypertrophy. Indeed, β-MyHC is emblematic of an entire “fetal gene program” that is normally low or absent in adult heart and myocytes and is induced in rodent models of pathological hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, including skeletal α-actin, β-tropomyosin, atrial natriuretic factor, and proto-oncogenes such as myc, fos and jun.7–9In the human ventricle, β-MyHC and skeletal α-actin are predominant normally,10,11but the concept of fetal gene induction in human myocardial disease appears to be valid, as represented by upregulation of atrial natriuretic factor, MB creatine kinase, and atrial β-MyHC.12–14If β-MyHC is indeed a valid marker for pathological cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, then 2 criteria would appear to follow. First, β-MyHC should be induced in most or all myocytes in a hypertrophied heart, and second, the myocytes expressing β-MyHC should be hypertrophied, or larger in size. However, a few reports indicate that endogenous β-MyHC is expressed heterogeneously in the overloaded myocardium,15,16a mean 30% of myocytes in 1 report,15and the same can be true for other fetal genes.16–18The most extensive study used a knock-in reporter mouse with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to the N-terminus of β-MyHC (YFP-β-MyHC). This approach estimated that myocytes positive for YFP-β-MyHC constituted 38% of total myocytes after prolonged transverse aortic constriction (TAC); YFP-β-MyHC–expressing myocytes were found in areas of fibrosis in several hypertrophy models and were hypertrophied to the same extent as myocytes that did not express β-MyHC.19–22Here, we sought to simultaneously quantify and size myocytes that expressed endogenous β-MyHC protein after TAC using an unbiased approach that did not rely on a genetic marker and that analyzed at least 10 000 cells per heart. To do this, we validated a flow cytometry technique using standard instruments and a commercial monoclonal antibody (mAb) for β-MyHC. Using this approach, we found that β-MyHC is induced after TAC in a minor s"

    "content": "AbstractBackground:Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) is now extensively used to address cosmetic concerns. OnabotulinumtoxinA (ONA, Botox; Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) received FDA approval for upper face rejuvenation, including glabella frown lines and crow’s-feet lines. The other off-label uses for lower face conditions have been utilized for contouring purposes, especially masseter hypertrophy. Recently, a new Daewoong BTA, (NABOTA®, NBT, Daewoong Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea), was recently introduced.Objective:To compare efficacy and safety of ONA and NBT for masseter reduction.Methods:Thirty-five subjects with masseter hypertrophy were randomly injected with 25 units of ONA on one side and 25 units of NBT on the other side into masseter. Standardized photographic documentation was obtained at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. The mean volume of masseter was acquired by using three-dimensional computed tomography (3-D CT) at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up visits. In addition, patients’ satisfaction and side effects were also record at every follow-up visits.Results:The mean masseter volume on the sides treated with ONA and NBT at baseline were 21.20 ± 4.23 cm3and 21.26 ± 4.58 cm3, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean volume of both sides (p= 0.827). The mean masseter volume at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits reduced significantly on both ONA and NBT sides (p< 0.001 andp< 0.001, respectively). However, there was no statistically significant difference in mean masseter volume when comparing between ONA and NBT sides at 3 and 6 months after treatment (p= 0.769 andp= 0.346, respectively). There was also no statistically significant difference in masseter reduction when compared between ONA and NBT sides evaluated by physicians and patients at each follow-up visit. No side effect on both sides was reported after injection.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that ONA and NBT provided comparable efficacy and safety for masseter reduction.Keywords:Botulinum toxin type Aonabotulinumtoxin ANabotamasseter reductionAcknowledgementsThis research project is supported by Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.

The present study evaluates the capacity of ET-1 to affect endothelin-1-associated hypertrophic activity and decreased expression of heme oxygenase-1 by H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts in vitro, corresponding to in vivo processes underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Beta estradiol (β-E) is tested for its capacity to alter the effects of ET-1. H9c2 cells, cultured 48 h, were stimulated with 100–10,000 nM of ET-1 and evaluated for changes in cell size, cell viability, and expression of the cytoprotective heat shock protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), with 200 nM of β-E included in selected cultures to evaluate its effect on ET-1-mediated changes. The application of 100 to 10,000 nM of ET-1 resulted in a significant increase in average cell size and decreases in both cell viability and HO-1 protein content (p< 0.05). Moreover, 200 nM of β-E was observed to significantly counteract these effects by cardiomyoblasts stimulated with 1000 nM of ET-1 (p< 0.05). Sprague-Dawley rats treated intravenously with 1000 ng/kg of ET-1 demonstrated reduced HO-1 expression in peripheral blood and left ventricular tissue, which was counteracted by injection of 200 ng/kg β-E—demonstrating a possible correspondence between in vitro and in vivo effects. An outcome of particular value for clinical use of β-E, in the management of cardiac hypertrophy, is the observed capacity of the drug to abate ET-1-mediated suppression of HO-1 expression. It has been previously demonstrated that HO-1 inducers exhibit potent cardioprotective properties, thus offering the promise of combining them with β-E, allowing lower effective dosage of the drug and concomitantly lower adverse side effects associated with its clinical use. Major findings of this investigation are that pretreatment of cardiomyoblasts with β-E inhibited their hypertrophic response to ET-1 and counteracts the decrease of cell viability. These effects were associated with a restoration of HO-1 protein expression in both under in vitro and in vivo conditions.Keywords:Heart failure (HF), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), β-Estradiol (β-E), Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Hypertrophy, H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast, In vitro, In vivo ratIntroductionCardiopulmonary and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) leading to respiratory and heart failure are the major cause of death and incapacitation in the EU and in many other areas of the world, particularly in developed nations (Nichols et al.2013).

The hypothesis to be tested was that the difference between right and left balance of occlusal force diminishes over time following BTX-A injection.Materials and MethodsFifteen patients were submitted to BTX-A injection therapy for subjective masseter hypertrophy. A total of 25 U of BTX-A (50 U in total) was injected into two points located 1 cm apart at the center of the lower one-third of both masseter muscles. All patients were examined using the T-Scan occlusion analysis system before and 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after BTX-A injection.ResultsA significant change in force balance was found between the right and left sides over time and the difference between the two sides decreased with the time post-injection, reaching a minimum at 12 weeks. Comparison of the force balance between the anterior and posterior occlusions revealed no significant difference at any of the time points. The occlusion and disclusion times (right and left sides) did not differ significantly with time since BTX-A injection.ConclusionA decline in the difference in the clenching force between the left and right sides was found with increasing time up to 12 weeks following BTX-A injection.Keywords:Botulinum toxin type A, bite force, dental occlusion, masseter muscle, mastication, time factorsINTRODUCTIONThe clinical use of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has expanded into the field of dentistry over the past decade. It is used in the treatment of masticatory and facial muscle spasm, severe bruxism, facial tics, orofacial dyskinesias, dystonias, and idiopathic hypertrophy of the masticatory muscles,1as well as in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders,2myofascial pain syndrome,3headaches such as chronic migraine,4recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), drooling, and Frey's syndrome.5Application of BTX-A to various orofacial regions in patients often requires injection into masticatory muscles such as the masseter and temporalis muscles, which can cause temporary muscle paralysis, weakness, and atrophy.The control of mastication is dependent in large part upon sensory feedback, which involves epithelial mechanoreceptors, periodontal, TMJ, and muscle afferents.6Changes in the afferent input from a muscle caused by injection of BTX-A can modify the response of the cortex and the motor neuron activity, and even initiate the activity of irrelevant muscles. Such injections into masticatory muscles can subsequently influence mastication directly by inducing muscle weakness and atrophy, as well as indirectly by influencing the central pattern generator in the brainstem via modification of the sensory feedback from the masticatory muscle spindle.7It has been often observed that BTX-A has analgesic effects and reduces hyperactivity in the injected muscle.8However, in our clinic, some patients with pretreatment unilateral chewing habits report an equalization of masticatory force after BTX-A injection. This effect of BTX-A has yet to be studied in detail.The T-Scan occlusion analysis system is a dental tool"

The Journal of Physiology © 2012 The Physiological SocietyPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC3473290 PMID:22802591AbstractLow-load resistance training with blood flow restriction has been shown to elicit substantial increases in muscle mass and muscle strength; however, the effect on myogenic stem cells (MSCs) and myonuclei number remains unexplored. Ten male subjects (22.8 ± 2.3 years) performed four sets of knee extensor exercise (20% 1RM) to concentric failure during blood flow restriction (BFR) of the proximal thigh (100 mmHg), while eight work-matched controls (21.9 ± 3.0 years) trained without BFR (control, CON). Twenty-three training sessions were performed within 19 days. Maximal isometric knee extensor strength (MVC) was examined pre- and post-training, while muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline (Pre), after 8 days intervention (Mid8) and 3 (Post3) and 10 days (Post10) post training to examine changes in myofibre area (MFA), MSC and myonuclei number. MVC increased by 7.1% (Post5) and 10.6% (Post12) (P< 0.001) with BFR training, while type I and II MFA increased by 38% (Mid8), 35–37% (Post3) and 31–32% (Post10) (P< 0.001). MSCs per myofibre increased with BFR training from 0.10 ± 0.01 (Pre) to 0.38 ± 0.02 (Mid8), 0.36 ± 0.04 (Post3) and 0.25 ± 0.02 (Post10) (P< 0.001). Likewise, myonuclei per myofibre increased from 2.49 ± 0.07 (Pre) to 3.30 ± 0.22 (Mid8), 3.20 ± 0.16 (Post3) and 3.11 ± 0.11 (Post10), (P <0.01). Although MFA increased in CON at Mid8, it returned to baseline at Post3. No changes in MSC or myonuclei number were observed in CON. This study is the first to show that short-term low-load resistance exercise performed with partial blood flow restriction leads to marked proliferation of myogenic stem cells and resulting myonuclei addition in human skeletal muscle, which is accompanied by substantial myofibre hypertrophy.Key pointsIn the last decade muscle training performed using a combination of low external loads and partial restriction of blood flow to the exercising limb has gained increasing interest, since it leads to significant gains in muscle strength and muscle mass.The cellular mechanisms responsible for the muscular adaptations induced by this training paradigm are not fully understood.This study shows that 3 weeks of high-frequency, low-intensity muscle exercise with partial blood flow restriction induces increases in maximal muscle strength accompanied by highly marked gains in muscle fibre size.Furthermore, the results indicate that these muscular adaptations rely on a considerable upregulation in myogenic satellite cells number, resulting in nuclear addition to the exercised myofibres.The results contribute to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying the g"

    "content": "ABSTRACTThis study examined the influence of resistance training (RT) proximity-to-failure, determined by repetitions-in-reserve (RIR), on quadriceps hypertrophy and neuromuscular fatigue. Resistance-trained males (n= 12) and females (n= 6) completed an 8-week intervention involving two RT sessions per week. Lower limbs were randomised to perform the leg press and leg extension exercises either to i) momentary muscular failure (FAIL), or ii) a perceived 2-RIR and 1-RIR, respectively (RIR). Muscle thickness of the quadriceps [rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL)] and acute neuromuscular fatigue (i.e., repetition and lifting velocity loss) were assessed. Data was analysed with Bayesian linear mixed-effect models. Increases in quadriceps thickness (average of RF and VL) from pre- to post-intervention were similar for FAIL [0.181 cm (HDI: 0.119 to 0.243)] and RIR [0.182 cm (HDI: 0.115 to 0.247)]. Between-protocol differences in RF thickness slightly favoured RIR [−0.036 cm (HDI: −0.113 to 0.047)], but VL thickness slightly favoured FAIL [0.033 cm (HDI: −0.046 to 0.116)]. Mean volume was similar across the RT intervention between FAIL and RIR. Lifting velocity and repetition loss were consistently greater for FAIL versus RIR, with the magnitude of difference influenced by the exercise and the stage of the RT intervention.Key PointsTerminating RT sets with a close proximity-to-failure (e.g., 1- to 2-RIR) can be sufficient to promote similar hypertrophy of the quadriceps as reaching momentary muscular failure in resistance-trained individuals over eight weeks, but the overall influence of proximity-to-failure on muscle-specific hypertrophy may also depend on other factors (e.g., exercise selection, order, and subsequent musculature targeted).Due to high repetition loss (from the first to final set) when sets are terminated at momentary muscular failure, performing RT with 1- to 2-RIR allows for similar volume load and repetition volume accumulation as reaching momentary muscular failure across eight weeks, possibly influencing the overall RT stimulus achieved.Performing RT to momentary muscular failure consistently induces higher levels of acute neuromuscular fatigue versus RT performed with 1- to 2-RIR; however, improved fatigue resistance overtime may attenuate acute neuromuscular fatigue and subsequent repetition loss (but may depend on the exercise performed).KEYWORDS:Resistance trainingfatigueproximity-to-failurerepetitions-in-reservemuscle hypertrophy1. IntroductionSkeletal muscle hypertrophy is a physiological adaptation to resistance training (RT), specifically driven by the repeated exposure of muscle fibres to mechanical tension (Wackerhage et al.,Citation2019). To promote meaningful muscle hypertrophy, it is accepted that resistance-trained individuals should terminate RT sets with a close proximity-to-failure (defined as the number of repetitions remaining in a set prior to momentary muscular failure) (Hickmott et al.,Citation2022; Refalo, Helms, Trexler, et al.,Citation2022). Whether closer proximities-to-failure during RTalwayspromote greater muscle hypertrophy, however, is contentious. For example, RT sets to momentary muscular failure may incur high levels of i) neuromuscular fatigue that impairs the stimulus acheived within a RT session (Alix-Fages et al.,Citation2022), and ii) muscle damage that compromises protein synthesis directed towards muscle hypertrophy (Damas et al.,Citation2016). Therefore, prescribing RT with a repetitions-in-reserve (RIR) scale to terminate sets close to, but not at momentary muscular failure has become common (Refalo, Helms, Hamilton, et al.,Citation2022; Zourdos et al.,Citation2016). The lack of research employing RIR prescription, however, and the uncertainties surrounding the relationship between proximity-to-failure, neuromuscular fatigue, and muscle hypertrophy, highlight key areas for future research to explore.To investigate the influence of proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy, previous research has compared either i) RT performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure (Lacerda et al.,Citation2020; Lasevicius et al.,Citation2019; S. Martorelli et al.,Citation2017; Nobrega et al.,Citation2018; Santanielo et al.,Citation2020), or ii) RT performed to different percentages of velocity loss from the first (or fastest) repetition (Andersen et al.,Citation2021; Pareja-Blanco et al.,Citation2017; Pareja-Blanco, Alcazar, Cornejo-Daza, et al.,Citation2020; Pareja-Blanco, Alcazar, SA-V, et al.,Citation2020; Rissanen et al.,Citation2022; Rodiles-Guerrero et al.,Citation2022). Specifically, meta-analysis (Refalo, Helms, Trexler, et al.,Citation2022) of this relevant literature shows no statistically significant difference between RT performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure for muscle hypertrophy, and that performing RT to high velocity loss thresholds (>25%) likely promotes greater muscle hypertrophy than low velocity loss thresho"

It has been shown to exert cardioprotection against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, studies regarding its antihypertrophic property are still lacking, whether it demonstrates similar antihypertrophic effect to its metabolite, quercetin. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of both flavonoids on oxidative stress and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in H9c2 cardiomyocytes that were exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II (600 nM) with or without quercetin (331 μM) or rutin (50 μM) for 24 h. A group given vehicle served as the control. The concentration of the flavonoids was chosen based on the reported effective concentration to reduce cell hypertrophy or cardiac injury in H9c2 cells. Exposure to Ang II increased cell surface area, intracellular superoxide anion level, NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities, and reduced cellular superoxide dismutase activity and nitrite level, which were similarly reversed by both rutin and quercetin. Rutin had no significant effects on phosphorylated proteins of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 but downregulated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2), which were induced by Ang II. Quercetin, on the other hand, had significantly downregulated the phosphorylated proteins of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2. The quercetin inhibitory effect on JNK1/2 was stronger than the rutin. In conclusion, both flavonoids afford similar protective effects against Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but they differently modulate MAPK pathway.Keywords:flavonoids, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, ERK, JNK, p38 kinase, inducible nitric oxide synthase1. IntroductionCardiac hypertrophy is commonly manifested in heart failure [1]. Neurohormonal system activation is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, with angiotensin II (Ang II) being the key player in inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes respond to Ang II by initiating several cascades that lead to hypertrophy [2]. The binding of Ang II on angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs), causes the dissociation of different G-proteins that activate several signaling kinases and phosphatases including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [2]. MAPKs are a group of serine and threonine protein kinases that are encoded by multiple genes. Extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2), and p38 kinase (p38) are three MAPKs that have been reported to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy [3]. Activation of AT1R by Ang II also activates NADPH oxidase that increases the gene"

This relationship implies that muscle fibers, which are triggered to simultaneously increase their mass/strength (hypertrophy) and fatigue resistance (oxidative capacity), increase these properties (strength or fatigue resistance) to a lesser extent compared to fibers increasing either of these alone. Muscle fiber size and oxidative capacity are determined by the balance between myofibrillar protein synthesis, mitochondrial biosynthesis and degradation. New experimental data and an inventory of critical stimuli and state of activation of the signaling pathways involved in regulating contractile and metabolic protein turnover reveal: (1) higher capacity for protein synthesis in high compared to low oxidative fibers; (2) competition between signaling pathways for synthesis of myofibrillar proteins and proteins associated with oxidative metabolism; i.e., increased mitochondrial biogenesis via AMP-activated protein kinase attenuates the rate of protein synthesis; (3) relatively higher expression levels of E3-ligases and proteasome-mediated protein degradation in high oxidative fibers. These observations could explain the fiber type–fiber size paradox that despite the high capacity for protein synthesis in high oxidative fibers, these fibers remain relatively small. However, it remains challenging to understand the mechanisms by which contractile activity, mechanical loading, cellular energy status and cellular oxygen tension affect regulation of fiber size. Therefore, one needs to know the relative contribution of the signaling pathways to protein turnover in high and low oxidative fibers. The outcome and ideas presented are relevant to optimizing treatment and training in the fields of sports, cardiology, oncology, pulmonology and rehabilitation medicine.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00421-010-1545-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords:Mitochondrial biogenesis, Protein synthesis, Skeletal muscle, Heart, AtrophyIntroductionThree decades ago, it was first demonstrated in humans that training at the same time for both strength and endurance results in less adaptation of skeletal muscles compared to training for either one alone, a phenomenon known as the concurrent training effect (Hickson1980). Generally, resistance exercise leads to an increase in muscle mass (hypertrophy), whereas endurance exercise is associated with increased oxidative metabolism (mitochondrial and capillary density, oxidative enzymes) and no hypertrophy. Why do muscles have limited capacity to increase strength (i.e., fiber size) and endurance capacity (i.e., oxidative metabolism) at the same time? To clarify the relationship between the regulation of fiber size and oxidative metabolism, the present review will focus on the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the size differences in high and low oxidative muscle fibers.

It also disrupts the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, dislocating nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS-1) and reducing sarcolemmal integrity. This study of quadriceps muscle in 18-mo-old mice showed that NO-donor treatment with isosorbide dinitrate (I) for 6 wk, in combination with voluntary exercise for 3 wk, increased muscle mass by 25% and stimulated cell proliferation. The resulting fiber hypertrophy was accompanied by a lower ratio of protein:DNA, consistent with myogenic-cell hyperplasia. Treatment enhanced the ratio of NOS-1:β-dystroglycan in correlation with fiber diameter, improved sarcolemmal integrity, and increased vascular density after an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor protein at 3 wk. Results demonstrate that age-related muscle refractoriness to exercise can be overcome with NO-donor treatment. Since activation of muscle stem cells and vascular perfusion are limiting factors in the maintenance, regeneration, and growth of aged muscle, results suggest the feasibility of using NO-donor drugs to combat atrophy and muscle ischemia. Improved function and quality of life from the NO-amplified effects of exercise may be useful in aging and other conditions such as disuse, insulin resistance, or microgravity.age-related muscle atrophyin humans is arguably inevitable, since 100% of older individuals experience some degree of sarcopenia (32). Muscle wasting results from atrophy of individual fibers, loss and expansion of motor units (24,37,79) that becomes increasingly severe from late-middle age to senescence in both fast- and slow-twitch muscles (63) and ultimately weakness limits function and quality of life. Current treatments, such as exercise and growth-promoting drugs, are not completely effective, in part as we do not fully understand the many facets of age-related atrophy.Progressive refractoriness of satellite cells (SC) to stimuli that promote growth in young mice, such as stretch (43) and exercise (36,44,45), is a major contributor to age-related atrophy. Muscle SC are required to maintain mass and repair muscle and are involved in growth via proliferation (4). Deficient activation of these cells by stretching in aged muscle (65,72,84) reduces or inhibits the potential for regeneration and hypertrophy (15,17,18). Since the normal process of SC activation depends on nitric oxide (NO) and signaling via hepatocyte growth factor and the c-met receptor (3,73,83), drugs that increase the NO concentration have potential to promote growth in old muscle. Research using a whole muscle culture system showed that the age-related reductions in muscle-specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-1) concentration and activity are reversed by treatment with a NO-donor drug, one that releases NO without activity of NOS (4"

Its pathology is sophisticated, and its progression is associated with multiple cellular processes. To explore new therapeutic approaches, more precise examination of cardiomyocyte subtypes and involved biological processes is required in response to hypertrophic stimuli. Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are two crucial organelles associated with the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and are connected through junctions known as mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). Although MAM genes are altered in cardiac hypertrophy, the importance of MAMs in cardiac hypertrophy and the expression pattern of MAMs in certain cardiac cell types require a comprehensive analysis. In this study, we analyzed the temporal expression of MAM proteins in the process of cardiac hypertrophy and observed that MAM-related proteins preferentially accumulated in cardiomyocytes at the initial stage of cardiac hypertrophy and underwent a gradual decline, which was synchronized with the proportion of two cardiomyocyte subtypes (CM2 and CM3). Meanwhile, these subtypes went through a functional switch during cardiac hypertrophy. Trajectory analysis suggested that there was a differentiation trajectory of cardiomyocyte subtypes from high to low MAM protein expression. Distinct regulon modules across different cardiomyocyte cell types were revealed by transcriptional regulatory network analysis. Furthermore, scWGCNA revealed that MAM-related genes were clustered into a module that correlated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Altogether, we identified cardiomyocyte subtype transformation and the potential critical transcription factors involved, which may serve as therapeutic targets in combating cardiac hypertrophy.Subject terms:Cardiovascular diseases, Heart failureIntroductionAs the first organ formed during embryo development stages, the heart undertakes billions of beats to sustain a well-circulated body with lovely oxygenated blood1.

The progeny of these newly proliferating satellite cells then fuse with the damaged muscle fibers so as to repair them. This process is generally able to maintain muscle strength and size but can tend to fail during the aging process and in certain disease states, such as in dystrophic muscle. This has spurred efforts to develop molecular and cellular therapies to stimulate the repair process.Figure 1.Open in a new tabA single satellite cell on a myofiber.Laminin is shown in red, DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is blue, and syndecan-4 is green. Syndecan-4 combined with the relative localization underneath the basal lamina (laminin stain) identifies the green cell as a satellite cell. (Courtesy of John Hall.)It is against this backdrop that Hallet al.1recently reported the startling finding that the transplantation of a small number of exogenous satellite cells—still localized within their cellular niche in close proximity to the muscle fiber—into damaged mouse muscle produced significant repair and growth of the muscle that persisted for nearly 2 years. Equally surprisingly, the transplanted cells were retained during this period in the absence of any immunosuppression, even though they were immunologically incompatible with those of the host. A key question arising from these remarkable findings is how fewer than 10 transplanted satellite cells can give rise to significant muscle hypertrophy, whereas the literally thousands of endogenous satellite cells already present in the muscle are unable to do so. It is also unclear why the transplanted cells were not rejected. Answering these key questions may have significant impact on the clinical development of cell transplantation for muscle repair and may open up new strategies for enhancing the inherent regenerative capacity of muscle.Several groups have tried over many years to develop a therapy for muscular dystrophies based on the transplantation of myoblasts—the downstream progeny of satellite cells—which have been shown to stimulate muscle repair.2In mouse experiments, the success of such attempts has required the transplantation of hundreds of thousands of myoblasts per muscle following pretreatment of the muscle by myotoxin injection, which mediates injury signals and induces muscle regeneration, and irradiation, which reduces the competition from the host satellite cells.3In recent years, several studies have reported that transplantation of a few freshly isolated satellite cells4,5,6or of a few myofibers still associated with their satellite cells within their niche position7produced better transplantation results (i.e., more hybrid muscle fibers formed in part by the transplanted cells) than delivery of these large numbers of myoblasts. However, such dramatic muscle hypertrophy as that reported by Hallet al.has not been previously observed following the transplantation of more than 1 million myoblasts, the transplantation of intact muscle fibers, or the transplantation of freshly isolated satellite cells.In the new study, the workers incubated freshly isolated muscle fibers for 4 to 5 hours with their associated satellite cells in a relatively standard growth medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor 2 and horse serum. Fibroblast growth factor 2 is known to stimulate the proliferation of myoblasts. One to five of these myofibers were then injected into the muscle of a normal mouse that had been treated with BaCl2or cardiotoxin to mediate the muscle fiber–injury signals necessary to initiate repair. The authors reported that this treatment protocol led to increased muscle strength and 35% muscle hypertrophy. Importantly, approximately 80% of the newly reg"

Since the ability of the cardiomyocyte to adapt to increased stress and workload depends on functional SRC, regulators of SRC may therefore play a central role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. In noncardiomyocytes, the mitochondrial ROMO1 (reactive oxygen species modulator 1) protein is an important redox-dependent regulator of mitochondrial SRC1by controlling electron transport system (ETS) activity.2However, little is known about the function of ROMO1 in the cardiomyocyte,3and whether ROMO1 regulates SRC or plays a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy remains to be determined.Meet the First Author, see p5To characterize the role of ROMO1 in the cardiomyocyte, we used short-interfering ROMO1 RNA to knockdown ROMO1 in cultured human AC16 cardiomyocytes (Figure [Ai]), followed by high-resolution respirometry. We show that ROMO1 knockdown had no effect on mitochondrial basal respiration but significantly reduced SRC (Figure [Aii]). Furthermore, since ROMO1 has been shown to be required for processing of the mitochondrial inner membrane fusion protein optic atrophy 1 in noncardiomyocytes1, we investigated whether mitochondrial dynamics were altered in cardiomyocytes following ROMO1 knockdown. Our data reveal that the loss of ROMO1 does not alter gross mitochondrial morphology, optic atrophy 1 global expression, optic atrophy 1 isoform expression, or other regulators of mitochondrial structure (Figure [Aiii through Av]). Importantly, we also observed that the loss of ROMO1 does not appreciably change the expression of ETS complexes (Figure [Av]), suggesting that ROMO1 functions primarily to maintain mitochondrial SRC in cardiomyocytes, likely through the modulation of flux through individual ETS complexes.Figure.ROMO1 (reactive oxygen species modulator 1) plays an obligate role in cardiac hypertrophy.

This review focuses on the potential of NSAIDs to alter the activity of satellite cells, the muscle stem cell responsible for repair and maintenance of skeletal muscle. The signaling pathways that are potentially modified by NSAID exposure are also considered. Growth factors as well as inflammatory cells and connective tissue appear to be key factors in the response of muscle under conditions where cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin activity are blocked through NSAID ingestion or infusion. Discrepancies in the literature regarding the response of young and old individuals are addressed, where it appears that the elderly may benefit from NSAID ingestion, although this clearly requires further study. The long-term implications for the muscle of the apparent inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on satellite cells in younger individuals are not clear, and it is possible these may first become apparent with chronic use in athletes training at a high level or with advancing age. Reports of the potential for NSAIDs to alter prostaglandin and growth factor signaling provide a basis for further study of the mechanism of NSAID action on satellite cells.satellite cells(seeFigs. 1and2) are a population of cells resident in adult skeletal muscle and have been proven to be essential for muscle repair (33,67). The cycle of satellite cell activity (seeFig. 3) has been most widely studied in models of muscle injury or overload where the satellite cells are awoken from their dormant state. Briefly, the main steps involved include1) activation to enter the cell cycle, and2) proliferation, after which the cells either3) undergo differentiation and fuse with a myofiber, or4) return to quiescence (24,50,68,95). With the capacity to perform these two functions, namely repairing damaged tissue and replenishing their own cell pool, satellite cells have been ascribed the status of the muscle stem cell. While it appears that satellite cells in the muscle of elderly individuals are not as easily activated as in younger individuals (11), triggering activation and proliferation in vivo appears to be relatively easy, and many factors are now recognized as being capable of this. For example, mechanical stimuli in the form of stretch or forceful contractions, damage to the muscle, pharmacological agents, and inflammatory conditions are strong activators of satellite cells. It appears from the literature that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can influence satellite cell activity, both directly and indirectly. This minireview will consider how NSAIDs can infl"

There were no risk factors for coronary artery disease. Clinical examination and 12-lead ECG were normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a finger-like projection in the paraseptal region towards the left ventricle (LV) measuring 5×1.4 cm (figures 1–4;videos 1–4).Grossly, it was mimicking LV mass without any gradient across (as opposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (neither concentric nor eccentric). Echotexture was the same as that of septum. MRI was performed to characterise the finger-like projection (figures 5and6;video 5). It proved to be a hypertrophied muscle band in LV as no different MR signals (hyperintense or hypointense) were found on cardiac MRI. Patient is on follow-up with crucial vigilance regarding any rhythm disturbance without any medications currently. A hypertrophied muscle band in LV can sometimes mimic apical cardiomyopathy1or LV mass. It is a rare echocardiographic finding in patients with normal LV wall thickness. Sometimes these bands may be associated with rhythm2disturbances but most of the cases have benign course. We confirmed our finding by cardiac MRI which is better for tissue characterisation.Figure 1.Open in a new tabApical 4-chamber view in transthoracic echocardiogram showing finger-like projection in paraseptal region.Figure 2.Open in a new tabApical 2-chamber view in transthoracic echocardiogram showing finger-like projection in paraseptal region and attached to apex.Figure 3.Open in a new tabParasternal short axis view in transthoracic echocardiogram showing finger-like projection in paraseptal region.Figure 4.Open in a new tabApical 2-chamber view in transthoracic echocardiogram showing the band in paraseptal region with dimensions.Figure 5.Open in a new tabCardiac MRI showing the 4-chamber view at mid-systole with no extraordinary tissue brightness.Figure 6.Open in a new tabCardiac MRI showing the 4-chamber view at mid-diastole with no extraordinary tissue brightness.Video 1Apical 4 chamber view in TTE showing finger like projection in paraseptal region.Your browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.Download video stream.Download video file(153.6KB, flv)DOI: 10.1136/bcr-2013-200819v1Open in a new tabVideo 2Apical 4 chamber view in TTE with colour Doppler with no evidence of any turbulence around the finger like structure.Your browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.Download video stream.Download video file(157.6KB, flv)DOI: 10.1136/bcr-2013-200819v2Open in a new tabVideo 3Parasternal short axis view in TTE showing finger like projection in paraseptal region.Your browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.Download video stream.Download video file(146.1KB, flv)DOI: 10.1136/bcr-2013-200819v3Open in a new tabVideo 4Modified apical 3 chamber view showing like projection in paraseptal region with attachment to apex.Your browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.Download video stream.Download video file(152.6KB, flv)DOI: 10.1136/bcr-2013-200819v4Open in a new tabVideo 5Cardiac MRI showing the 4 chamber view in one cardiac cycle with no extraordinary tissue brightness.Your browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.Download video stream.Download "

The rates of protein synthesis are primarily dependent on translational efficiency and capacity. Ribosome biogenesis has emerged as an important regulator of skeletal muscle growth and maintenance by altering the translational capacity of the cell. Here, we provide evidence to support a central role for ribosome biogenesis in skeletal muscle growth during postnatal development and in response to resistance exercise training. Furthermore, we discuss the cellular signaling pathways regulating ribosome biogenesis, discuss how myonuclear accretion affects translational capacity, and explore future areas of investigation within the field.IntroductionCell growth is defined as an increase in cell mass (85). Cell growth is often conflated with cell proliferation because the two processes are typically coordinated to ensure cell size is maintained upon division (85). The uncoupling of cell growth from cell division can lead to an increase in cell size; this hypertrophic growth has been observed in differentiated, post-mitotic cells such as those of the liver, kidney, adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle (35,45,63,72,129). In particular, adult skeletal muscle cells are capable of dramatically increasing their size in response to increased mechanical loading, stretch, and growth factor signaling (1,8,10,45,128). A defining characteristic of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in both humans and rodents is a robust increase in the rate of protein synthesis (43,138).A primary determinant of skeletal muscle mass is the relationship between protein synthesis and protein degradation; a sustained, net increase in the rate of protein synthesis will ultimately lead to the accumulation of cellular protein resulting in muscle fiber hypertrophy (43,44,144). In general, the rate of protein synthesis is determined by two factors: translational efficiency and translational capacity. Translational efficiency is defined as protein synthesis per unit RNA, whereas translational capacity is determined by the total ribosomal content and often is expressed as the total RNA content per unit tissue (79,83). Translational efficiency and capacity are coordinately regulated with the emerging notion (borrowed from the cardiac field) that the initial increase in translational efficiency observed following a hypertrophic stimulus is required for the subsequent increase in translational capacity, which allows for the sustained increase in protein synthesis necessary for skeletal muscle hypertrophy (53,136). The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview on ribosome biogenesis, its regulation during muscle growth, and the evidence demonstrating that ribosome biogenesis is an important mediator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy.The RibosomeThe ribosome is a macromolecular machine responsible for the translation of mRNA into protein, i.e., protein synthesis. The mature ribosome (80S in eukaryotes) is composed of a small subunit (40S) and a large subunit (60S). Each subunit contains distinct ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and associated ribosomal proteins (r-proteins); the large 60S subunit is formed by 28S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs, and 47 r-proteins with the small 40S subunit "

In the case of pathological forms of cardiac hypertrophy, such as occurs with chronic pressure overload, the heart undergoes well-defined fuel utilization changes.1–3The normal adult heart uses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as its chief source of ATP production. With pathological hypertrophic growth, FAO rates fall concordant with an increase in glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that changes in myocardial fuel utilization impact the hypertrophic growth response and subsequent remodeling en route to heart failure. For example, inborn errors in mitochondrial FAO enzymes in humans often result in a hypertrophic form of cardiomyopathy.4Conversely, mice with cardiac-specific deletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2), which results in constitutively high cardiac FAO rates, are protected against the development of cardiac hypertrophy and pathological remodeling in response to pressure overload or angiotensin II infusion in mice.5ACC2 generates malonyl-CoA, a key negative regulator of fatty acid import into the mitochondrion at the step catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that reduced flux through FAO and increased glucose utilization is required for the cardiac hypertrophic response. Consistent with this general concept, it is well known that cancer cells often require anaerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect)6to maintain high rates of cellular proliferation.To begin to delineate the potential mechanistic connections between cardiac fuel utilization shifts and hypertrophic growth, Ritterhoff et al7conducted a series of studies in cardiac myocytes in culture and in vivo in mice to determine whether specific components of myocardial substrate oxidation influence cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth. First, a series of experiments conducted in adult rat cardiac myocytes in culture demonstrated that the hypertrophic response to phenylephrine was blocked by maintaining high FAO rates via ACC2 knockdown. However, if glucose utilization was increased by overexpressing Glut1 (glucose transporter), or by administering dichloroacetate (to increase glucose oxidation), the hypertrophic response was observed, even in the context of ACC2 deficiency. Next, targeted metabolomics conducted in the cultured cardiac myocyte model demonstrated that during the hypertrophic response, levels of aspartate, glutamine, and ribose-5-phosphate were increased, a response that was blocked with ACC2 knockdown. Notably, these metabolites are involved in nucleotide synthesis and related anabolic pathways. Consistent with the observed metabolomic changes, rates of RNA and protein synthesis were also increased by phenylephrine but not in the context of ACC2 knockdown. Importantly, supplementation of the myocytes with either aspartate or glutamine rescued the hypertrophic response in the ACC2 knockdown myocytes. These collective results suggested that maintenance of high rates of FAO prevented cardiac myocyte hypertrophy by suppressing glucose utilization, the latter of which was necessary for the growth response by increasing levels of anabolic metabolites that feed into nucleotide and protein synthesis.How does the switch from FAO to glucose utilization trigger an increase in aspartate and other anabolic metabolites? To answer this question, Ritterhoff et al7conducted13C stable isotope tracer studies in the in vitro cardiac myocyte hypertrophy model to determine the source of increased aspartate during hypertrophic growth. It should be noted that the vast majority of aspartate in cardiac myocytes is derived from biosynthesis via oxaloacetate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediate, rather than by cellular import. Accordingly, the13C studies focused on the source of carbon input into the TCA cycle for generation of aspartate during hypertrophic growth. The 2 likely candidates were glutamine and glucose. Tracer flux studies using U-13C glutamine demonstrated that the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle was minimal. In contrast, U-13C glucose via pyruvate oxidation was a major contributor to aspartate synthesis, and this input was significantly increased during phenylephrine-stimulated cardiac myocyte growth. In addition,15N-aspartate tracer studies demonstrated that aspartate contributed nitrogen into nu"

Here we investigated the role of adenosine receptors and adenosine metabolism in attenuation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Phenylephrine (PE) caused hypertrophy of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with increases of cell surface area, protein synthesis, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression. These responses were attenuated by 5 μM 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; adenosine deaminase resistant adenosine analog) or 10 μM adenosine. While antagonism of adenosine receptors partially blocked the reduction of ANP expression produced by CADO, it did not restore cell size or protein synthesis. In support of a role for intracellular adenosine metabolism in regulating hypertrophy, the adenosine kinase (AK) inhibitors iodotubercidin and ABT-702 completely reversed the attenuation of cell size, protein synthesis, and expression of ANP by CADO or ADO. Examination of PE-induced phosphosignaling pathways revealed that CADO treatment did not reduce AKTSer473phosphorylation but did attenuate sustained phosphorylation of RafSer338(24–48 h), mTORSer2448(24–48 h), p70S6kThr389(2.5–48 h), and ERKThr202/Tyr204(48 h). Inhibition of AK restored activation of these enzymes in the presence of CADO. Using dominant negative and constitutively active Raf adenoviruses, we found that Raf activation is necessary and sufficient for PE-induced mTORC1 signaling and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. CADO treatment still blocked p70S6kThr389phosphorylation and hypertrophy downstream of constitutively active Raf, however, despite a high level phosphorylation of ERKThr202/Tyr204and AKTSer473. Reduction of Raf-induced p70S6kThr389phosphorylation and hypertrophy by CADO was reversed by inhibiting AK. Together, these results identify AK as an important mediator of adenosine attenuation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which acts, at least in part, through inhibition of Raf signaling to mTOR/p70S6k.adenosine is known to exertcardioprotective effects, including protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury (5,30,34), reduction of oxidative stress (31,37), and attenuation of hypertrophy and heart failure during pressure overload (26,27,43). In support of a protective role for adenosine, we observed that deletion of cd73 (the ectonucleotidase that produces extracellular adenosine from AMP) exacerbated left ventricular hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction in mice exposed to chronic pressure overload produced by transv"

Much of the preclinical rodent and human resistance training research to date supports that involved mechanisms include enhanced mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, an expansion in translational capacity through ribosome biogenesis, increased satellite cell abundance and myonuclear accretion, and postexercise elevations in muscle protein synthesis rates.

GRK5 is highly expressed within myocardium and is upregulated in heart failure. Although GRK5 is a critical regulator of cardiac G protein–coupled receptor signaling, recent data has uncovered noncanonical activity of GRK5 within nuclei that plays a key role in pathological hypertrophy. Targeted cardiac elevation of GRK5 in mice leads to exaggerated hypertrophy and early heart failure after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) because of GRK5 nuclear accumulation.Objective:In this study, we investigated the role of GRK5 in physiological, swimming-induced hypertrophy (SIH).Methods and Results:Cardiac-specific GRK5 transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermate control mice were subjected to a 21-day high-intensity swim protocol (or no swim sham controls). SIH and specific molecular and genetic indices of physiological hypertrophy were assessed, including nuclear localization of GRK5, and compared with TAC. Unlike after TAC, swim-trained transgenic GRK5 and nontransgenic littermate control mice exhibited similar increases in cardiac growth. Mechanistically, SIH did not lead to GRK5 nuclear accumulation, which was confirmed in vitro as insulin-like growth factor-1, a known mediator of physiological hypertrophy, was unable to induce GRK5 nuclear translocation in myocytes. We found specific patterns of altered gene expression between TAC and SIH with GRK5 overexpression. Further, SIH in post-TAC transgenic GRK5 mice was able to preserve cardiac function.Conclusions:These data suggest that although nuclear-localized GRK5 is a pathological mediator after stress, this noncanonical nuclear activity of GRK5 is not induced during physiological hypertrophy.IntroductionG protein–coupled receptors regulate various intracellular pathways and are known to play an integral role in modulation of the cardiovascular system. G protein–coupled receptors are regulated by G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in a process termed desensitization, leading to halting of the signal, receptor internalization, and degradation or resensitization.1,2GRK2 and GRK5 are the predominant GRKs expressed in the myocardium and are known to be upregulated in human heart failure (HF) where they can shut-off overstimulated G protein–coupled receptors, such as β-adrenergic receptors.1The role of GRK2 in HF development after myocardial injury has been well documented1,3; however, only recently has a critical role for GRK5 in HF pathogenesis begun to be elucidated.Studying the role of increased myocardial GRK5, as seen in human HF, in a cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model (TgGRK5) has revealed a key role in HF pathogenesis after ventricular pressure overload after transverse aortic constriction (TAC).4–6With cardiac elevation of GRK5, it was found that after TAC, there is exaggerated hypertrophic growth of the heart with accelerated maladaptation and early HF.4–6Interestingly, this phenotype does not depend on the canonical activity of GRK5 but rather its ability to localize in the nucleus of myocytes wherein it acts as a Class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) kinase, resulting in nuclear export of HDAC5 and derepression of cardiac hypertrophic gene transcription through myocyte enhancer factor 2.4,5Recently, we have discovered that in addition to the derepression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 activity after TAC, GRK5 has the ability to bind DNA directly and in a kinase-independent manner act as a positive coregulator of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)–mediated hypertrophic gene transcription.6To confirm whether myocardial GRK5 is an endogenous HDAC5 kinase, mice with either global or cardiac myocyte–specific GRK5 knockout displayed significantly less hypertrophy and prevention of maladaptation after TAC with less HDAC5 exported from the nucleus.7These data confirm that GRK5 is a potent regulator of pathological hypertrophy; however, a role for this GRK in another form of hypertrophy, physiological hypertrophy, has yet to be elucidated.Physiological hypertrophy occurs during pregnancy and after endurance training, such as swimming.

IntroductionCardiac hypertrophy is a common denominator of a constellation of clinical abnormalities that includes hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or even athlete heart among others. Physiologically it happens when these conditions make heart work harder than usual. While cardiac hypertrophy is a compensatory phenomenon (to minimize wall stress) and is generally symptomatically silent, its clinical consequences arise as a result of either arrhythmias or its progression to symptomatic heart failure. For clinician it is very important not only to pick up this transition from hypertrophic to dilated state early but also to understand the natural history of cardiac hypertrophy as well as to screen for the triggers that culminate into this eventuality. For basic scientists it is important to identify and quantitate these triggers so that appropriate diagnostic facilities can be developed to aid the physicians in diagnosing the situation. Currently heart failure has become an important public health problem not only in developed but in developing world as well. The purpose of this review is to focus on the key pathological and molecular triggers in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy to failure and serve as a common ground between basic scientists and clinicians.2. Physiologic basis of cardiac hypertrophy1Cardiac hypertrophy occurs as a consequence to increased workload and is characterized by an increase in the size of cardiac myocyte. Conventionally cardiac hypertrophy is classified into two types, either physiological or pathological. Physiological stimuli, like exercise and pregnancy may lead to cardiac hypertrophy, which is characterized by normal cardiac structure, conserved or improved cardiac function, and negligible alteration in cardiac gene expression pattern. On the other hand, the pathological hypertrophy, which occurs in response to pressure or volume overload in various diseases, is characterized by cardiac dysfunction, reactivation of fetal gene program, interstitial fibrosis, and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, revelation of various signaling pathways associated with these two forms of hypertrophy are of paramount importance for developing specific therapy against heart failure or preventing transition of cardiac hypertrophy to failure.Despite its importance, our understanding of the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure in humans is far from adequate.3. Pathologic basis for cardiac hypertrophy2,3Cardiac fibrosis is an important characteristic feature of pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. It is characterized by an increase in collagens and various other extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the heart muscle. As we know, ECM forms the scaffold of the heart and is composed of a number of complex macromolecules, like collagens, elastic fibers, etc. The ECM provides a scaffold for an organized systolic contraction of the heart from a force originally generated by individual myocytes. It also provides stiffness in diastole and prevents overstretch, myocyte sliding, and tissue deformation during ventricular filling within a physiological limit. At the biochemical level, ECM also serves as modulators of tissue growth and tissue differentiation.Fibrosis is multi-factorial in its etio-pathogenesis and can be stimulated by several pathological processes, like ischemia, aging, inflammation, and various paracrine as well as autocrine hormones. Usually there are two types of fibrosis, reparative fibrosis and reactive fibrosis. Reparative fibrosis occurs due to ECM deposition during scar formation following tissue injury or cell death, a very common phenomenon in ischemia or aging. Reactive fibrosis, on the other hand, occurs due to increased ECM deposition around vessels and in interstitium due to direct stimulation of fibroblasts without cell injury, which very commonly occurs in hypertension. Fibrosis plays an important contributory role in deterioration of cardiac function in the progression to heart failure.3.1. Evidence from human autopsyHuman autopsy studies have shown that the degree of cardiac fibrosis is directly proportional to the left ve"

In response to high blood pressure, the left ventricle manifests hypertrophic growth to ameliorate wall stress, which may progress into decompensation and trigger pathological cardiac remodeling. Despite the clinical importance, the temporal dynamics of pathological cardiac growth remain elusive. Here, we took advantage of the puromycin labeling approach to measure the relative rates of protein synthesis as a way to delineate the temporal regulation of cardiac hypertrophic growth. We first identified the optimal treatment conditions for puromycin in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte culture. We went on to demonstrate that myocyte growth reached its peak rate after 8–10 h of growth stimulation. At the in vivo level, with the use of an acute surgical model of pressure-overload stress, we observed the maximal growth rate to occur atday 7after surgery. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis supports that the most profound transcriptomic changes occur during the early phase of hypertrophic growth. Our results therefore suggest that cardiac myocytes mount an immediate growth response in reply to pressure overload followed by a gradual return to basal levels of protein synthesis, highlighting the temporal dynamics of pathological cardiac hypertrophic growth.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe determined the optimal conditions of puromycin incorporation in cardiac myocyte culture. We took advantage of this approach to identify the growth dynamics of cardiac myocytes in vitro. We went further to discover the protein synthesis rate in vivo, which provides novel insights about cardiac temporal growth dynamics in r"

Glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1), as a transcriptional regulator, belongs to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing gene family. QRICH1 has been shown to influence the outcomes of endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the transcription of proteostasis-related genes. In this study, we explored the role of QRICH1 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.MethodsWe observed an increased expression of QRICH1 in the hearts of humans and mice with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). To assess the functional impact in this context, we employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches, using AAV9 injections to establish cardiac-specific QRICH1 knockdown or overexpression models in transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or isoproterenol (ISO)-"

At the molecular level, this results in both transient and long-term changes to metabolic, sarcomeric, ion handling, and stress signaling pathways. Although this is initially an adaptive change, the mechanisms underlying LVH eventually lead to maladaptive changes including fibrosis, decreased cardiac function, and failure. Understanding the regulators of long-term changes, which are largely driven by transcriptional remodeling, is a crucial step in identifying novel therapeutic targets for preventing the downstream negative effects of LVH and treatments that could reverse or prevent it. The development of effective therapeutics, however, will require a critical understanding of what to target, how to modify important pathways, and how to identify the stage of pathology in which a specific treatment should be used.Keywords:gene regulation, transcription, left ventricular hypertrophy, molecular cardiac controlIntroductionPathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a clinically noticeable indicator of cardiac stress downstream of a number of different conditions that result in decreased cardiac function or capacity. The heart is immensely flexible, able to work under different oxygen conditions, different physical loads, and in the presence of varying metabolic substrates. In many cases, however, comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension create a persistent change in circulating nutrients, hormones, and cytokines. When these persistent changes accompany altered physical load on the heart, molecular and physical flexibility are hindered and the heart cannot maintain efficient pumping over time.Cardiomyocytes are the “workhorse” cells of the heart that generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and carry out the physical contraction. In the case of LVH, persistent changes force the cardiomyocyte to alter its steady state molecular signature that produces the ATP required for pumping. These alterations can be roughly grouped into two main categories. The first adaptations are transient and cause changes in protein activity or expression, primarily from post-transcriptional regulation. These modifications occur rapidly and can be rapidly reversed as needed. The second set of adaptations are long-term and driven by gene remodeling; they occur when the transient changes are no longer sufficient for maintaining efficiency. Extensive gene remodeling, such as during cardiac stress, generally indicates a long-term adaptation that cannot easily be reversed.Due to the complexity of LVH, an accurate model requires consideration of all cardiac cell types, each with their own transcription program and regulatory mechanisms. However, to explain the possible role of transcriptional targeting in clinical practice, this review will focus primarily on changes in the cardiomyocyte. The intention is not to provide an inclusive, detailed review of all transcriptional regulators in the cardiomyocyte but to use well-characterized transcriptional control mechanisms of the cardiomyocyte during stress and LVH as examples to highlight treatment strategies and current challenges.Transcriptional Remodeling During Cardiac StressUltimately, adaptation of the heart is required to maintain cardiomyocyte contraction and is therefore aimed at metabolic efficiency. After birth, the gene expression profile of the heart changes dramatically in terms of metabolic regulators and sarcomeric gene expression. These changes are thought to reflect the drastic shift in cellular environment that occurs at birth, which is driven by the change from low oxygen availability in utero to unrestricted oxygen after birth. This change in oxygen state allows the adult heart to rely heavily on oxidative metabolism of fatty acids for ATP generation.In the case of pressure overload to the left ventricle, the first observed molecular changes in the heart are metabolic, particularly increased glucose uptake.1This increased glucose is initially sufficient to create the ATP required to meet the increased load; however, if the stress persists over time, the cardiomyocyte eventually switches to anaerobic glycolysis as the main metabolic pathway. This switch is accompanied by extensive gene remodeling to the “fetal gene profile,” referring to those genes expressed during t"

Male Wistar rats were divided into control (Cont), blood flow restriction (Bfr), electrical stimulation (Es), or Bfr with Es (Bfr + Es) groups. Pressure cuffs (80 mmHg) were placed around the thighs of Bfr and Bfr + Es rats. Low-current Es was applied to calf muscles in the Es and Bfr + Es rats. Inexperiment 1, a 1-day treatment regimen (5-min stimulation, followed by 5-min rest) was delivered four times to study the acute effects. Inexperiment 2, the same treatment regimen was delivered three times/wk for 8 wk. Body weight, muscle mass, changes in maximal isometric contraction, fiber cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle, expression of phosphorylated and total-ERK1/2, phosphorylated-rpS6 Ser235/236, phosphorylated and total Akt, and phosphorylated-rpS6 Ser240/244were measured. Bfr and Es treatment alone failed to induce muscle hypertrophy and increase the expression of phosphorylated rpS6 Ser240/244. Combined Bfr + Es upregulated muscle mass, increased the fiber cross-sectional area, and increased phosphorylated rpS6 Ser240/244expression and phosphorylated rpS6 Ser235/236expression compared with controls. Combined treatment with Bfr and low-current Es can induce muscle hypertrophy via activation of two protein synthesis signaling pathways. This treatment should be introduced for older patients with sarcopenia and others with muscle weakness.NEW & NOTEWORTHYWe investigated the acute and chronic effect of low-current electrical stimulation with blood flow restriction on skeletal muscle hypertrophy and the mechanisms controlling the hypertrophic response. Low-current electrical stimulation could not induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy, but a combination treatment did. Blood lactate and growth hormone levels were increased in the early response. Moreover, activation of ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways were observed in "

In vitro evidence suggests that the scaffold protein muscle A-kinase anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ) serves as a nodal organizer of hypertrophic signaling. However, the relevance of mAKAPβ signalosomes to pathological remodeling and heart failure in vivo remains unknown.Methods and Results—Using conditional, cardiac myocyte–specific gene deletion, we now demonstrate that mAKAPβ expression in mice is important for the cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and catecholamine toxicity. mAKAPβ targeting prevented the development of heart failure associated with long-term transverse aortic constriction, conferring a survival benefit. In contrast to 29% of control mice (n=24), only 6% of mAKAPβ knockout mice (n=31) died in the 16 weeks of pressure overload (P=0.02). Accordingly, mAKAPβ knockout inhibited myocardial apoptosis and the development of interstitial fibrosis, left atrial hypertrophy, and pulmonary edema. This improvement in cardiac status correlated with the attenuated activation of signaling pathways coordinated by the mAKAPβ scaffold, including the decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase D1 and histone deacetylase 4 that we reveal to participate in a new mAKAP signaling module. Furthermore, mAKAPβ knockout inhibited pathological gene expression directed by myocyte-enhancer factor-2 and nuclear factor of activated T-cell transcription factors that associate with the scaffold.Conclusions—mAKAPβ orchestrates signaling that regulates pathological cardiac remodeling in mice. Targeting of the underlying physical architecture of signaling networks, including mAKAPβ signalosome formation, may constitute an effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of pathological remodeling and heart failure.IntroductionCongestive heart failure (CHF), the end stage of many heart diseases, is a syndrome affecting >5 million people in the United States alone.1Current pharmacological treatment for CHF includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antagonists for β-adrenergic, angiotensin II, and aldosterone receptors, as well as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and other vasodilators. Nevertheless, 5-year mortality for CHF remains 50%, providing impetus for novel therapeutic approaches.Clinical Perspective on p672Regardless of the pathogenesis, the common response of the heart to stress is cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.1Hypertrophy can be compensatory for increased wall stress (Laplace law). However, in disease, hypertrophy is typically concomitant with impaired contractility, myocyte death, and myocardial interstitial fibrosis, resulting in progressive systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Consequently, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a leading CHF risk factor. Within the myocyte, pathological remodeling is controlled by a network of signaling pathways composed of plasmalemmal receptors, second messengers, protein kinases and phosphatases, regulators of gene transcription, and other signaling molecules.2These pathways are organized by scaffold proteins that physically colocalize signaling enzymes with their upstream activators and substrate effectors.3Formation of signalosomes by scaffolds increases the efficiency of signal transduction by affording additional specificity to enzyme catalysis, accelerating pathway kinetics, amplifying responses, and providing the infrastructure for feed-forward and feedback loops. Scaffold proteins that organize nodes in the hypertrophic signaling network may provide alternative therapeutic targets specific to the disease process.Muscle A-kinase anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ; AKAP6) is a 227 kDa scaffold located at the nuclear envelope in striated myocytes.4Studies using cultured neonatal myocytes have implicated mAKAPβ signalosomes in G-protein–coupled receptor, cytokine receptor, and hypoxia-regulated signaling, including the activation of gene expression by nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc), myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transcription factors.5–11Despite extensive biochemical characterization of mAKAPβ complexes, the relevance of the scaffold to cardiac disease"

Coupling between Ca2+handling and contractile properties in dystrophic hearts is poorly understood. It is also not clear whether developing cardiac failure is dominated by alterations in Ca2+pathways or more related to the contractile apparatus. We simultaneously recorded force and Ca2+transients in field-stimulated papillary muscles from young (10–14 weeks) wild-type (wt) and dystrophic mdx mice. Force amplitudes were fivefold reduced in mdx muscles despite only 30 % reduction in fura-2 ratio amplitudes. This indicated mechanisms other than systolic Ca2+to additionally account for force decrements in mdx muscles. pCa-force relations revealed decreased mdx myofibrillar Ca2+sensitivity. ‘In vitro’ motility assays, studied in mdx hearts here for the first time, showed significantly slower sliding velocities. mdx MLC/MHC isoforms were not grossly altered. Dystrophic hearts showed echocardiography signs of early ventricular wall hypertrophy with a significantly enlarged end-diastolic diameter ‘in vivo’. However, fractional shortening was still comparable to wt mice. Changes in the contractile apparatus satisfactorily explained force drop in mdx hearts. We give first evidence of early hypertrophy in mdx mice and possible mechanisms for already functional impairment of cardiac muscle in DMD.Keywords:papillary muscle, muscular dystrophy, calcium, force transients, motility assayIntroductionDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive, wasting muscle disease that originates from numerous point mutations in the X-"

The heart undergoes hypertrophy in response to mechanical load but hypertrophy can regress upon unloading. We hypothesize that autophagy plays an important role in mediating regression of cardiac hypertrophy during unloading. Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 1 week, after which the constriction was removed (DeTAC). Regression of cardiac hypertrophy was observed after DeTAC, as indicated by reduction of LVW/BW and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Indicators of autophagy, including LC3-II expression, p62 degradation and GFP-LC3 dots/cell, were significantly increased after DeTAC, suggesting that autophagy is induced. Stimulation of autophagy during DeTAC was accompanied by upregulation of FoxO1. Upregulation of FoxO1 and autophagy was also observedin vitrowhen cultured cardiomyocytes were subjected to mechanical stretch followed by incubation without stretch (de-stretch). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of FoxO1 exhibited smaller hearts and upregulation of autophagy. Overexpression of FoxO1 in cultured cardiomyocytes significantly reduced cell size, an effect which was attenuated when autophagy was inhibited. To further examine the role of autophagy and FoxO1 in mediating the regression of cardiac hypertrophy,beclin1+/−mice and cultured cardiomyocytes transduced with adenoviruses harboring shRNA-beclin1or shRNA-FoxO1 were subjected to TAC/stretch followed by DeTAC/de-stretch.

Vascular hypertrophy of resistance vessels leads to reduced compliance and elevation of blood pressure. We showed before that increased expression of profilin1 protein in the medial layer of the aorta induces stress fiber formation, triggering the hypertrophic signaling resulting in vascular hypertrophy and, ultimately, hypertension in older mice. Our hypothesis is that profilin1 induced vascular hypertrophy in resistance vessels, which led to elevation of blood pressure, both of which contributed to the modulation of vascular function. Our results showed significant increases in the expression of α1- and β1-integrins (280 ± 6.3 and 325 ± 7.4%, respectively) and the activation of the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) II pathway (260 and 350%, respectively,P< 0.05) in profilin1 mesenteric arteries. The activation of Rho/ROCK led to the inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression (39 ± 5.4%;P< 0.05) and phosphorylation (35 ± 4.5%;P< 0.05) but also an increase in myosin light chain 20 phosphorylation (372%,P< 0.05). There were also increases in hypertrophic signaling pathways in the mesenteric arteries of profilin1 mice such as phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (312.15 and 232.5%, respectively,P< 0.05). Functional analyses of mesenteric arteries toward the vasoactive drugs were assessed using wire-myograph and showed significant increases in the vascular responses of profilin1 mesenteric arteries toward phenylephrine, but significant decreases in response toward ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, ACh, sodium nitrite, and cytochalasin D.

In a dilated left ventricle (LV), pharmacological heart rate lowering is associated with a reduction in LV chamber size. In patients with HFrEF, this structural change is associated with better survival. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasingly prevalent but, so far, without any evidence-based treatment. HFpEF is typically associated with LV concentric remodeling and hypertrophy. The effects of heart rate on this structural phenotype are not known. Analogous with the benefits of a low heart rate on a dilated heart, we hypothesized that increased heart rates could lead to potentially beneficial remodeling of a concentrically hypertrophied LV. This was explored in an established porcine model of concentric LV hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our results suggest that a moderate increase in heart rate can be used to reduce wall thickness, normalize LV chamber volumes, decrease myocardial fibrosis, and improve LV compliance. Our results also indicate that the effects of heart rate can be titrated, are reversible, and do not induce HF. These findings may provide the rationale for a novel therapeutic approach for HFpEF and its antecedent disease substrate.Listen to this article’s corresponding podcast athttp://ajpheart.podbean.com/e/heart-rate-modeling/.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis study is the first to explore if moderate heart rate elevations could be therapeutically employed to induce beneficial structural changes in the concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle. The result that heart rate elevations can induce structural changes that improve diastolic filling challenges the canonical thought that they are harmful.heart failure(HF) is a leading cause of hospitalizations and a major public health problem (7). About half of patients with HF have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and the prevalence of HFpEF is growing relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (19,24). No treatment has b"

Global gene expression patterns were determined from microarray results ondays 1,3,5,7,10, and14during plantaris muscle hypertrophy induced by synergist ablation in adult mice. Principal component analysis and the number of differentially expressed genes (cutoffs ≥2-fold increase or ≥50% decrease compared with control muscle) revealed three gene expression patterns during overload-induced hypertrophy: early (1 day), intermediate (3, 5, and 7 days), and late (10 and 14 days) patterns. Based on the robust changes in total RNA content and in the number of differentially expressed genes, we focused our attention on the intermediate gene expression pattern. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed a downregulation of genes encoding components of the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway during hypertrophy. Among these genes, five were predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis or previously shown to be regulated by the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor-15, which was also downregulated during hypertrophy. Moreover, the integrin-linked kinase signaling pathway was activated during hypertrophy, and the downregulation of muscle-specific micro-RNA-1 correlated with the upregulation of five predicted targets associated with the integrin-linked kinase pathway. In conclusion, we identified two novel pathways that may be involved in muscle hypertrophy, as well as two upstream regulators (Kruppel-like factor-15 and micro-RNA-1) that provide targets for future studies investigating the importance of these pathways in muscle hypertrophy.adult skeletal muscle massis primarily dictated by the net balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. It is well established that muscle hypertrophy is the result of a sustained, net increase in the rate of protein synthesis that ultimately leads to the accr"

In SDT rats, left ventricular (LV) ANG II, but not circulating ANG II, increased at 8 and 16 wk after diabetes onset. SDT rats developed LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction at 8 wk, followed by LV systolic dysfunction at 16 wk, without hypertension. The SDT rat LV exhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression at 8 wk and to a greater degree at 16 wk and interstitial fibrosis at 16 wk only. In SDT rats, coronary angiogenesis increased with enhanced capillary proliferation and upregulation of the angiogenic factor VEGF at 8 wk but decreased VEGF with enhanced capillary apoptosis and suppressed capillary proliferation despite the upregulation of VEGF at 16 wk. In SDT rats, the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 increased at 8 wk alone, whereas the expression of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 increased at 16 wk alone. All these events, except for hyperglycemia or blood pressure, were reversed by olmesartan medoxomil. These results suggest that LV ANG II in SDT rats at 8 and 16 wk induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy without affecting hyperglycemia or blood pressure, which promotes and suppresses coronary angiogenesis, respectively, via VEGF and thrombospondin-1 produced from hypertrophied cardiomyocytes under chro"

We report the case of a 13-year-old girl with bilateral submandibular gland aplasia associated with symmetrical sublingual gland hypertrophy that herniated from bilateral mylohyoid defects and presented as bilateral masses on CT and MRI images. Prolapsed bilateral sublingual gland hypertrophy should be considered in patients with bilateral submandibular masses to avoid unnecessary biopsy or surgery. We suggest that radiological evaluation of these cases should be performed before any intervention.Keywords:submandibular, aplasia, mylohyoid, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imagingIntroductionMajor salivary gland aplasia is frequently seen in some congenital disorders including lacrimoauriculodentodigital (LADD) syndrome, mandibulofacial dysostosis and ectodermal dysplasia associated with aplasia or dysplasia of lacrimal or thyroid glands.1-3However, isolated aplasia of major salivary glands is a very rare entity that is most commonly seen in parotid glands.4Clinically, patients may be asymptomatic or may present with dryness of the mouth, have difficulty in chewing and swallowing and suffer from dental caries. Also, pseudomasses can be seen as a result of compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral or other major salivary glands, or accessory salivary tissue.5The muscular base of the oral cavity is formed by the mylohyoid muscle that forms a sling inferior to the tongue. It inserts on the slightly obliquely orientated mylohyoid line on the medial surface of the mandible, with the posterior aspect more cranial than the anterior aspect. The muscle is thickest posteriorly, and thins as it approaches the mental tubercle. Defects of this muscle are common; radiologically detectable deficiencies were identified in three of four individuals in a previous study.6To the best of our knowledge, there are very limited cases of isolated aplasia of bilateral submandibular glands associated with bilateral sublingual gland hypertrophies in the literature.7,8In those reports, CT findings were reported in adult patients. Ahmed et al reported a case of non-syndromic bilateral submandibular gland aplasia with hypertrophied sublingual salivary tissue, the latter herniating through the mylohyoid boutonnière to present as a palpable mass on the left side with corresponding CT findings.7In this report, we present CT and MRI findings of a 13-year-old girl with bilateral submandibular gland aplasia associated with symmetrical sublingual gland hypertrophy that herniated from bilateral mylohyoid defects presenting as bilateral masses.Case reportA 13-year-old girl was referred for CT examination for bilateral submandibular masses pronounced with swallowing. She was otherwise healthy and first became aware of the masses 1 year previously. She had no history of head and neck cancer or surgery. No dental caries was noticed. Bilateral non-tender submandibular masses were noticed that became pronounced with modified Valsalva movement on physical examination (Figure 1). No sign of inflammation was observed. There was no adenopathy, and oral, pharyngeal and maxillofacial examination revealed no pathological finding.Figure 1.Open in a new tabBilateral submandibular masses of the patient. No abnormality is seen at rest (a); however, masses appear following modified Valsalva movement (b)Sonography was performed for initial radiological evaluation. Bilateral submandibular glands were not identified and symmetrical masses with glandular echogenicity were seen anterior to the expected locations of submandibular glands. No lymphadenopathy was detected. A routine CT of the soft tissues of the neck with intravenous contrast was performed. On the CT there were no pathological lymphadenopathy or masses. Submandibular glands could not be identified on transverse, multiplanar or maximum intensity projection (MIP) images (Figure 2). Bilateral enhancing hypertrophied sublingual salivary tissue accompanied by symmetrical mylohyoid defects was seen (Figure 3). Both sublingual glands protruded to the submandibular space through "

As such, HCM provides remarkable opportunities to study how changes to the heart’s molecular motor apparatus may influence cardiac structure and function. Although the genetic basis of HCM is well-described, there is much more limited understanding of the precise consequences of sarcomere mutations—how they remodel the heart, and how these changes lead to the dramatic clinical consequences associated with HCM. More precise characterization of the mechanisms leading from sarcomere mutation to altered cardiac muscle function is critical to gain insight into fundamental disease biology and phenotypic evolution. Such knowledge will help foster development of novel treatment strategies aimed at correcting and preventing disease development in HCM.Keywords:Cardiac muscle mechanics, Thin filament, Thick filament, Myofilament calcium sensitivity, Excitation contraction coupling, Cardiac muscle energeticsBackground and IntroductionHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of the myocardium. Traditionally, it has been characterized by the presence of unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)—increased LV wall thickness which occurs in the absence of other causes, such as pressure overload (systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis) or other multisystem illness (storage or infiltrative diseases). Pathognomonic histological features of HCM are myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 1).Fig. 1.Open in a new tabHCM is characterized by LVH, myocyte disarray, and myocardial fibrosisHCM is often familial with autosomal dominant inheritance. Genome-wide linkage studies in the 1980s led to the discovery of pathogenic mutations in genes that encode different components of the contractile apparatus. This discovery established the paradigm that HCM is a disease of the sarcomere. Disease-causing (pathogenic) mutations have been identified in the genes encoding cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), cardiac troponin I (TNNI3), α tropomyosin (TPM1), essential and regulatory myosin light chains, and cardiac actin (Seidman and Seidman 2001;Richard et al. 2006). Sarcomere mutations can be identified in ~60 % of individuals with familial HCM and in ~20–30 % of patients with HCM who do not have a family history (Richard et al. 2006). TheMYH7andMYBPC3genes are most commonly involved. As the prevalence of unexplained LVH is estimated at 1 in 500 to 1000 (Maron et al. 1995) HCM is the most common monogenic cardiovascular disorder.HCM is highly complex and heterogeneous. There is substantial variation in clinical manifestations, cardiac morphology, symptom burden, and prognosis (Gersh et al. 2011). Although most patients with HCM have a normal life expectancy, symptoms of pulmonary congestion, chest pain, and exercise intolerance result in substantial limitations despite medical or surgical therapy. HCM can also result in striking events, including the development of end stage heart failure leading to death or cardiac transplantation, or a high risk of sudden cardiac death.The clinical diagnosis of HCM has traditionally relied on identifying unexplained LVH. However this strategy has important limitations. Although the gene mutation responsible for causing HCM is present before birth, the development of LVH is highly age-dependent and LV wall thickness is usually normal during childhood. LVH commonly emerges in adolescence or early adulthood, although for some individuals, clinically overt disease may not be detectable for decades more (Niimura et al. 1998;Maron et al. 2004). Very little is known about how disease develops or the mechanisms that drive cardiac remodelling. With gene-based testing, at-risk sarcomere mutation carriers (G+) can be identified before they ca"

To identify the mechanisms by which simvastatin inhibits cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload, we determined effects of simvastatin on 14-3-3 protein expression and autophagic activity. Simvastatin was administered intragastrically to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats before abdominal aortic banding (AAB). Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs) were treated with simvastatin before angiotensin II (AngII) stimulation. 14-3-3, LC3, and p62 protein levels were determined by western blot. Autophagy was also measured by the double-labeled red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein autophagy reporter system. Simvastatin alleviated excessive autophagy, characterized by a high LC3II/LC3I ratio and low level of p62, and blunted cardiac hypertrophy while increasing 14-3-3 protein expression in rats that had undergone AAB. In addition, it increased 14-3-3 expression and inhibited excessive autophagy in NRCs exposed to AngII. Our study demonstrated that simvastatin may inhibit excessive autophagy, increase 14-3-3 expression, and finally exert beneficial effects on cardioprotection against pressure overload.Keywords:14-3-3, autophagy, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin, hypertrophyIntroductionAutophagy is a catabolic process that degrades damaged cellular proteins and organelles. It is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis1. However, prolonged and excessive autophagy is maladaptive and can result in cell death2. Hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth and dysfunction are associated with various forms of heart diseases, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease3,4. Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed a tight link between cardiomyocyte autophagy and cardiac hypertrophy5. Excessive autophagy can occur in hypertrophied cardiac myocytes6. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy for cardiac hypertrophy are attractive.Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular-related mobility and mortality independently of their cholesterol-lowering function7. Simvastatin, a statin, has been shown to have pleiotropic effects, such as reducing cardiac hypertrophy8,9. However, the effects of simvastatin "

Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is a multifunctional regulator that participates in immune regulation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. However, the role of IRF7 in cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. We performed aortic banding in cardiac-specific IRF7 transgenic mice, IRF7 knockout mice, and the wild-type littermates of these mice. Our results demonstrated that IRF7 was downregulated in aortic banding–induced animal hearts and cardiomyocytes that had been treated with angiotensin II or phenylephrine for 48 hours. Accordingly, heart-specific overexpression of IRF7 significantly attenuated pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction, whereas loss of IRF7 led to opposite effects. Moreover, IRF7 protected against angiotensin II–induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified that IRF7-dependent cardioprotection was mediated through IRF7 binding to inhibitor of κB kinase-β, and subsequent nuclear factor-κB inactivation. In fact, blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling with cardiac-specific inhibitors of κBαS32A/S36Asuper-repressor transgene counteracted the adverse effect of IRF7 deficiency. Conversely, activation of nuclear factor-κB signaling via a cardiac-specific conditional inhibitor of κB kinase-βS177E/S181E(constitutively active) transgene negated the antihypertrophic effect of IRF7 overexpression. Our data demonstrate that IRF7 acts as a novel negative regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB signaling and may constitute a potential therapeutic target for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.IntroductionSee Editorial Commentary, pp663–664Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in response to increased biomechanical stress (ie, hypertension, valvular disease, myocardial infarction, or endocrine disorders). It is characterized by enlarged cardiomyocytes, enhanced protein synthesis, accumulation of extracellular matrices, and activation of the fetal cardiac gene program.1,2Although exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy can enhance heart function, pathological hypertrophy is an initial compensatory response to increased cardiac workload, which can ultimately result in heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death.3,4During the past few decades, several signal transduction pathways have been suggested to contribute to the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, including the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, the cAMP-response element binding protein pathway, the protein kinase C pathway, and the calcineurin pathway.5–10Importantly, these signaling pathways converge in the nucleus to activate various transcriptional regulators, such as nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), activator protein-1, GATA transcription factors, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and myocyte enhancer factor-2, which drive the expression of fetal cardiac and stress response genes that promote pathological cardiac hypertrophy.6–8,11However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the critical transition from compensated hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure have remained elusive. Therefore, elucidation of these transcriptional reprogramming processes is essential for identifying potential transcriptional therapies aimed at preventing pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors comprising 9 members (IRF1-9) in mammalian cells. They were initially found to play an essential role in modulating the expression of type I interferons (IFN-α and -β),12but recent studies have indicated that IRFs also play critical roles in antiviral defense, immune response, hematopoietic development, cell growth/apoptosis, cardiac remodeling, and oncogenesis.13–15Among the 9 family members, IRF7 binds to the DNA consensus sequence GAAWNYGAAANY widely existing in genes,16which indicates that IRF7 may modulate a more diverse range of target genes. In fact, a recent study by Honda et al17has described IRF7 as a master transcription factor in the reg"

    "content": "ABSTRACTThis study compared the effects of 90° versus 40° hip flexion in the leg extension exercise on quadriceps femoris muscle hypertrophy. Twenty-two untrained men completed a ten-week intervention comprising two resistance training sessions per week. A within-participant design was used, with the lower limb side randomly allocated to the 40 or 90° condition. Muscle thickness of distal and proximal rectus femoris and vastus lateralis was quantified via ultrasound. Data were analysed within a Bayesian framework including univariate and multivariate mixed effect models with random effects to account for the within participant design. Differences between conditions were estimated as average treatment effects (ATE) and inferences were made based on posterior distributions and Bayes Factors (BF). Results indicated a greater hypertrophic response in the rectus femoris for the 40° condition, with “extreme” evidence supporting a hypertrophic response favouring the 40° hip angle for the rectus femoris (BF > 100; p(Distal/ATE & Proximal/ATE >0) > 0.999), and “strong” evidence supporting no difference in hypertrophic response for the vastus lateralis (BF = 0.07). Therefore, both conditions could be viable options for increasing quadriceps femoris hypertrophy. However, when training for maximizing rectus femoris hypertrophy among untrained men, we suggest training with a reduced hip flexion in the leg extension exercise.KEYWORDS:Knee extensionvastus lateralisrectus femorishypertrophyIntroductionResistance training is a popular method to increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Roberts et al.,Citation2023). Regional or inhomogeneous muscle hypertrophy, characterized by an increase in the size of a specific muscle region relative to others, has been documented to occur from resistance training (Zabaleta-Korta et al.,Citation2023). For instance, different selections of resistance exercise have been observed to impact regional hypertrophy (Maeo et al.,Citation2021,Citation2023).One muscle group that has been reported to be influenced by the selection of resistance exercises on regional muscle hypertrophy is the quadriceps femoris (Zabaleta-Korta et al.,Citation2021). Substantial muscle growth has been noted in the monoarticular vastii muscles from multi-joint lower-body exercises (Kubo et al.,Citation2019; Larsen et al.,Citation2022). The rectus femoris is the only muscle of the quadriceps that is a biarticular muscle, functioning as both a hip flexor and knee extensor (Kojic et al.,Citation2022). Due to the biarticular nature of the rectus femoris, it has been postulated that closed-chain multi-joint exercises like the back squat mainly induce muscle growth of the monoarticular vastii muscles (Kojic et al.,Citation2022). Several previous studies using the squat exercise with different protocols, measuring quadriceps femoris growth, have reported minimal hypertrophy of the rectus femoris following weeks of squat training (Kojic et al.,Citation2022; Kubo et al.,Citation2019; Zabaleta-Korta et al.,Citation2021). Moreover, Zabaleta-Korta et al. (Citation2021) compared the effects of smith machine squats and the leg extensions on distal, central, and proximal hypertrophy of the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis during five weeks of resistance training. The researchers observed that all three regions of the rectus femoris hypertrophied for the leg extension group, whereas muscle growth was only observed at the central measurement site in the vastus lateralis among the squat group.Findings may, however, be influenced by contraction type. Eccentric leg extensions have been observed to preferentially train the rectus femoris and result in minimal hypertrophy of the vastus muscles (Maeo et al.,Citation2018), and previous studies suggest that eccentric movements may result in increased hypertrophy at the distal portion of the quadriceps femoris (Franchi et al.,Citation2014). Thus, the differences in eccentric lifting duration, standardized to two seconds by Zabaleta-Korta et al. (Citation2021) but not mentioned in the studies by Kojic et al. (Citation2022) and Kubo et al. (Citation2019) may limit the ability to draw clear conclusions. In addition, previous studies have employed different protocols, with these differences able to influence findings. For example, the participants in Kojic et al. (Citation2022), trained parallel squats twice a week for seven weeks in which exercises increased from 60 to 70% with 3 to 4 sets over the period, while the participants in Kubo et al. (Citation2019) squatted for ten weeks starting with the same intensity, but more repetitions to a higher intensity. Zabaleta-Korta et al. (Citation2021) conducted only a 5-week resistance training programme with 4 sets of 12 repetitions, but training three times per week, with each set taken to momentary failure. Thereby, due to these differences in intervention duration, proximity-to-failure, training volume, and frequency between these studies, it is difficu"

Some evidence suggests that suppression of pathological cardiac hypertrophyper seis a viable target for therapeutic intervention, and cardiomyocyte autophagy is an attractive mechanism for consideration as a means of controlling the hypertrophic response. However, whereas considerable insights have been gleaned in the molecular mechanisms governing cardiomyocyte autophagy, many details critical to rational targeting of the response remain unknown. Among them, mechanisms underlying the adaptive and maladaptive features of autophagy are obscure. With time and further study, it is possible that this near-ubiquitous cardiac response to stress will emerge as a viable target for therapeutic manipulation.Keywords:Autophagy, Cardiac Hypertrophy, Myocardial Ischemia, Heart failure, TherapeuticsIntroductionThe heart responds to ever-present changes in environmental stimuli with an array of responses which include alterations in chamber volumes, systolic contraction, diastolic relaxation, and heart rate. Beyond this, another critical component of the cardiac response to stress is robust change – either upward or downward – in muscle mass.1The heart is capable of substantial increases and declines in size and mass, and those changes can take place in remarkably short periods of time.Many of the environmental signals converging on the heart are physiological in nature, including postnatal growth, exercise, or pregnancy; here, cardiac mass increases or decreases rapidly and yet structure and function are preserved.2Many influences converging on the heart, however, are pathological, occurring in the context of disease. These include neurohormonal activation, hypertension, or myocardial injury, stressors which trigger perturbations in metabolic, structural, and functional properties of the heart. In the case of the former (physiological hypertrophy) untoward sequelae do not arise over time; in the case of the latter (pathological hypertrophy) progression to a state of ventricular wall thinning, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and a clinical syndrome of heart failure is common.3Further, both pathological hypertrophy and heart failure are associated with markedly increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia.4From a teleological perspective, the early phases of cardiac hypertrophy may be a compensatory response to increased workload, serving to normalize wall stress and thereby minimize oxygen consumption. In the long run, however, pathological hypertrophy is a milestone in the pathogenesis of heart failure.4Unlike the physiological hypertrophic growth response, pathological hypertrophy entails more than just increases in myocyte size and heightened sarcomeric organization. Rather, a shift toward glycolytic metabolism, alterations in calcium storage and handling, changes in contractility, and reactivation of a fetal gene program are seen.1In this way, patterns of gene expression mimic those seen in early embryonic development. The myosin composition of the cardiomyocyte is altered, and extracellular deposition of collagen leads to fibrosis, together contributing, at least in part, to diminished contractile performance.5These distinguishing characteristics of pathological hypertrophy raise obvious questions regarding whether this response is adaptive and protective. Indeed, preclinical studies have shown that attenuation of load-induced hypertrophy is well tolerated and furthermore, ventricular dilation and decompensation do not occur.6Correlative studies in patients with heart disease similarly support this contention.7Thus, sup"

In response to the overload, individual cardiac myocytes become mechanically stretched and activate intracellular hypertrophic signaling pathways to re-use embryonic transcription factors and to increase the synthesis of various proteins, such as structural and contractile proteins. These hypertrophic responses increase oxygen demand and promote myocardial angiogenesis to dissolve the hypoxic situation and to maintain cardiac contractile function; thus, these responses suggest crosstalk between cardiac myocytes and microvasculature. However, sustained pathological overload induces maladaptation and cardiac remodeling, resulting in heart failure. In recent years, specific understanding has increased with regard to the molecular processes and cell–cell interactions that coordinate myocardial growth and angiogenesis. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of coordinated myocardial growth and angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.The heart is one of the first organs to develop in the embryo. During embryonic development, the heart grows via proliferation and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes.1Heart tube formation is initiated around embryonic day 8 in the mouse, and this primitive avascular structure consists of a few layers of cardiac myocytes, which are located adjacent to endocardial cells and receive nutrients and oxygen through diffusion.2Because the myocardial wall increases in thickness by myocyte proliferation, the endocardial surface area also increases by progressive trabeculation, allowing maximal diffusion. However, as the myocardium grows further, nutrients and oxygen delivered by diffusion become insufficient, a primitive vascular plexus starts to develop shortly after initiation of heart contraction.3Angiogenic precursor cells, including angioblasts from the proepicardial organ and from the sinus venosus, differentiate into endothelial cells and assemble into a primitive capillary network in a process known as coronary vasculogenesis. Subsequently, this primitive capillary plexus expands by endothelial sprouting from preexisting capillaries in a process referred to as coronary angiogenesis.2,3Because cardiac myocytes discontinue the cell cycle soon after birth, subsequent growth of the heart is achieved predominantly by hypertrophy of individual cardiac myocytes during postnatal development. Individual cardiomyocytes increase in size ≥3- to 4-fold after birth.2The increased oxygen and metabolic demands of growing cardiac myocytes are accommodated by a significant expansion of the myocardial vasculature. These vessels further differentiate and acquire specific properties of coronary arteries or veins. After birth, the myocardial vascular plexus expands through not only angiogenesis but also physiological neovascularization, in which endothelial progenitor cells are involved.2,3Cardiac hypertrophy in normal growth or in trained athletes is referred to as physiological hypertrophy and is characterized by normal or enhanced contractile function and normal architecture and organization of cardiac structure.4In contrast, cardiac hypertrophy in patients with hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, or structural heart diseases is referred to as pathological hypertrophy and is often associated with contractile dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis, and re-expression of fetal cardiac genes, such as genes coding natriuretic peptides and the β-myosin heavy chain.4,5Pathological hypertrophy is also associated with cardiac structural remodeling and myocardial fibrosis, and sustained pathological hypertrophy leads to congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death.6During the development of hypertrophy, interstitial cells, such as capillary endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts, also dynamically undergo a phenotypic change to support contractile function of the myocardium.5,6According to morphometry of hypertrophied hearts in animal models, capillary microvasculature and myocytes grow in proportion to the inc"

For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.comPMC Copyright noticePMCID: PMC3078804 PMID:21502371AbstractThe most notable change in the metabolic profile of hypertrophied hearts is an increased reliance on glucose with an overall reduced oxidative metabolism, i.e. a reappearance of the foetal metabolic pattern. In animal models, this change is attributed to the down-regulation of the transcriptional cascades promoting gene expression for fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in adult hearts. Impaired myocardial energetics in cardiac hypertrophy also triggers AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to increased glucose uptake and glycolysis. Aside from increased reliance on glucose as an energy source, changes in other glucose metabolism pathways, e.g. the pentose phosphate pathway, the glucosamine biosynthesis pathway, and anaplerosis, are also noted in the hypertrophied hearts. Studies using transgenic mouse models and pharmacological compounds to mimic or counter the switch of substrate preference in cardiac hypertrophy have demonstrated that increased glucose metabolism in adult heart is not harmful and can be beneficial when it provides sufficient fuel for oxidative metabolism. However, improvement in the oxidative capacity and efficiency rather than the selection of the substrate is likely the ultimate goal for metabolic therapies.Keywords:Glycolysis, Metabolic flexibility, Foetal metabolic profile1. IntroductionGlucose is an important fuel that is used by nearly all organisms through a common set of metabolic pathways. Our knowledge of glucose metabolism dates back to 1860 with the identification of glycolysis by Louis Pasteur and climaxes in 1937 when the complete glycolytic pathway was unearthed through the work of Gustav Embden and Otto Fritz Meyerhof.1In the same year, building on the work of Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Hans A. Krebs and William A. Johnson showed that pyruvate could form succinate in animal tissues, thus providing the foundation for the citric acid cycle.2More than 20 years later, Peter D. Mitchell hypothesized a chemiosmotic mechanism that ultimately led to the elucidation of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation,3and thus, completed the pathway for aerobic glucose metabolism for ATP generation.We now know that glucose can be metabolized in multiple pathways providing not only an energy supply, but also many other important metabolites for cell growth and function.Figure1provides an overview of the metabolic fates of glucose in a cardiac myocyte. Glucose enters the cardiac myocyte by facilitated diffusion via glucose transporters (GLUT). GLUT1 and GLUT4 are the major isoforms present in the heart; GLUT1 mediates insulin-independent and GLUT4 mediates insulin-sensitive glucose transport. Intracellular glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and through glycolysis eventually yields pyruvate, which is oxidized in the mitochondria. Although the amount of ATP derived from glycolysis is rather small (2ATP/glucose), it has been proposed to play a critical role for the maintenance of ion pump function due to the proximity of glycolytic enzymes and the ATPases.4,5However, G-6-P can also be processed in several other pathways such as glycogen synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), or the aldose reductase (AR)/polyol pathway. In addition, the formation of fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) can feed through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Although glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation are the preferred fates of glucose, the accessory pathways play important roles in regulating biological functions of the cell.Figure 1.Open in a new tabGlucose metabolism pathways. 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate; 6-PGL, 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone; AR, aldose reduc"

    "content": "ABSTRACTThis study investigated the effect of knee flexion range of motion (ROM) during the leg press exercise on quadriceps femoris muscle hypertrophy in resistance-trained individuals. Twenty-three participants (training age: 7.2 ± 3.5 years) completed a within-participant design, performing four sets of unilateral leg presses to momentary failure twice weekly for 8 weeks. In one leg, the knee flexion range of motion (ROM) was fixed at approximately 5–100°, while for the other leg, participants used their maximum individualized ROM (5–154 ± 7.8°). Quadriceps muscle thickness was assessed via B-mode ultrasonography in the proximal, central, and distal regions of the mid- and lateral thighs. Bayesian analyses were conducted to quantify treatment effects and provide inferential estimates using credible intervals and Bayes Factors (BF). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated ‘moderate’ (BF = 0.14 to 0.22) and ‘extreme’ (BF < 0.01) evidence in support of the null hypothesis, respectively. Within-condition analyses revealed small-to-medium hypertrophic adaptation in both conditions, with absolute increases ranging from 1.08 mm to 1.91 mm. These findings suggest that both knee flexion ROMs are similarly effective for promoting quadriceps femoris muscle hypertrophy over a relatively short training-period in resistance-trained individuals.KEYWORDS:Muscle lengthknee extensorsresistance trainingultrasonographyregional hypertrophyIntroductionResistance training (RT) has been widely employed to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Roberts et al.,Citation2023). Over the past decade, the range of motion (ROM) used in various resistance exercises has received increased attention and remains a controversial topic in the research community (Wolf et al.,Citation2023). One muscle group reported to be influenced by knee flexion ROM is the quadriceps femoris (Bloomquist et al.,Citation2013; Kubo et al.,Citation2019; McMahon et al.,Citation2014; Pedrosa et al.,Citation2022). In multi-joint exercises like squats, superior muscle growth of monoarticular vastii muscles has been reported with greater knee flexion ROM (Zabaleta-Korta et al.,Citation2021). Conversely, single joint exercises like the leg extension may be beneficial when targeting the biarticular rectus femoris due to a fixed hip joint angle (Burke et al.,Citation2024). Moreover, Bloomquist et al.Citation2013compared the effects of squatting with 60° versus 120° of knee flexion and reported superior quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) gains for the 120° condition. This may be partly attributable to the quadriceps femoris reaching longer muscle lengths on the descending limb of the length – tension curve (Son et al.,Citation2018). Similarly, McMahon et al. (Citation2014) observed larger CSA increases for the distal vastus lateralis when training several different RT exercises to 90° knee flexion compared to 50°. Importantly, the researchers did not observe statistical differences between knee flexion ROMs in the more proximal parts of the vastus lateralis (McMahon et al.,Citation2014), indicating that a larger knee flexion ROM may exclusively confer favourable hypertrophic adaptations of the distal vastus lateralis.In addition to the previously mentioned studies, Kubo et al. (Citation2019) examined the effects of 10 weeks of squat training performed to 90° versus 140° of knee flexion on hip extensor and quadriceps femoris muscle volume. The authors reported favourable hypertrophic adaptations for the hip extensors with greater ROM, but no significant between-group differences for the quadriceps femoris. Based on these collective findings (Bloomquist et al.,Citation2013; Kubo et al.,Citation2019; McMahon et al.,Citation2014), some researchers have postulated that squatting to ~90–100° knee flexion ROM (0° represents full knee extension) may be sufficient for maximizing muscle hypertrophy of the quadriceps femoris (Ottinger et al.,Citation2023). Notably, isometric training at ~100° knee flexion has been observed to induce greater mechanical tension on the muscle-tendon complex compared to shorter muscle lengths (Kubo et al.,Citation2006). Since mechanical tension is considered a key stimulus for initiating hypertrophic response to resistance exercise (Schoenfeld,Citation2010), the greater quadriceps femoris growth typically observed with longer muscle lengths may be attributed to larger mechanical tension. However, during squatting as used in the study conducted by Kubo et al. (Citation2019), both segment ratios (Demers et al.,Citation2018) and ankle mobility (Fuglsang et al.,Citation2017) may influence an individual’s ability to perform a deep squat with a large knee flexion ROM. Importantly, Kubo et al. (Citation2019) stated in their methods that the participants squatted to approximately 140° knee flexion ROM. As a result, it is unclear how many of the participants were in fact capable of descending to a knee flexion ROM of 140°.The leg press is often "

Recent attention has focused on the role of COX-2 in human heart failure and diseases, due to the finding that highly specific COX-2 inhibitors (i.e. Vioxx) increased the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in chronic users. However, the specific impact of COX-2 expression in the intact heart remains to be determined. We report here the development of a transgenic mouse model, using a loxP-Cre approach, that displays robust COX-2 overexpression and subsequent prostaglandin synthesis specifically in ventricular myocytes. Histological, functional and molecular analyses showed that ventricular myocyte specific COX-2 overexpression led to cardiac hypertrophy and fetal gene marker activation, but with preserved cardiac function. Therefore, specific induction of COX-2 and prostaglandinin vivois sufficient to induce compensated hypertrophy and molecular remodeling.Keywords:cyclooxygenase, COX-2, transgenic, hypertrophy, compensatoryIntroductionThe role of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in inflammation and disease has long been appreciated due to the anti-inflammatory effects of mixed or preferential COX-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib (Vioxx)[1]. The importance of COX-2 in human heart disease was brought to public attention by the relatively recent finding that chronic use of the COX-2 selective inhibitor Vioxx increased the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke[2]. While these findings definitively link COX-2 to heart disease, they reveal nothing about the underlying mechanisms of this pathology.Conflicting results have been reported for the role of COX-2 in heart disease models of myocarditis. COX-2 promotes inflammation and disease in models of autoimmune myocarditis [3] and inflammatory lipid induced myocarditis[4]. On the other hand, COX-2 is protective in the disease states of virally induced myocarditis[5], as well as other disease models. Similarly, COX-2 is both detrimental [6] and protective [7] in experimental models of cardiac ischemia. These conflicting reports in the literature have prevented a clear understanding of the role of COX-2 in heart pathology, making it difficult to understand and manage the risks of COX-2 specific inhibitors in human health.Genetic models of COX-2 deletion and overexpression can be important tools to "

Mutations inSNTA1are associated with arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. Previous research on SNTA1 has been based on non-human cardiomyocytes. This study was designed to identify the phenotype ofSNTA1-deficiency using human cardiomyocytes.MethodsSNTA1was knocked out in the H9 embryonic stem cell line using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. H9SNTA1KO cells were then induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes using small molecule inhibitors. The phenotypic discrepancies associated withSNTA1-deficient cardiomyocytes were investigated.ResultsSNTA1was truncated at the 149th amino acid position of PH1 domain by a stop codon (TGA) using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.SNTA1-deficiency did not affect the pluripotency of H9SNTA1KO, and they retain their in vitro ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. However, H9SNTA1KO derived cardiomyocytes exhibited hypertrophic phenotype, lower cardiac contractility, weak calcium transient intensity, and lower level of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Early treatment ofSNTA1-deficient cardiomyocytes with ranolazine improved the calcium transient intensity and cardiac contractility.ConclusionSNTA1-deficient cardiomyocytes can be used to research the etiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapies for myocardial diseases. TheSNTA1-deficient cardiomyocyte model suggests that the maintenance of cardiac calcium homeostasis is a key target in the treatment of myocardial-related diseases.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary materia"

The underlying signaling can be triggered and interrogated in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) using sophisticated pharmacological and genetic techniques. However, the methods for quantifying cell growth are, by comparison, inadequate. The lack of quantitative, calibratable and computationally-inexpensive high-throughput technology has limited the scope for using cultured myocytes in large-scale analyses. We present a ratiometric method for quantifying the hypertrophic growth of cultured myocytes, compatible with high-throughput imaging platforms. Protein biomass was assayed from sulforhodamine B (SRB) fluorescence, and image analysis calculated the quotient of signal from extra-nuclear and nuclear regions. The former readout relates to hypertrophic growth, whereas the latter is a reference for correcting protein-independent (e.g. equipment-related) variables. This ratiometric measure, when normalized to the number of cells, provides a robust quantification of cellular hypertrophy. The method was tested by comparing the efficacy of various chemical agonists to evoke hypertrophy, and verified using independent assays (myocyte area, transcripts of markers). The method's high resolving power and wide dynamic range were confirmed by the ability to generate concentration-response curves, track the time-course of hypertrophic responses with fine temporal resolution, describe drug/agonist interactions, and screen for novel anti-hypertrophic agents. The method can be implemented as an end-point in protocols investigating hypertrophy, and is compatible with automated plate-reader platforms for generating high-throughput data, thereby reducing investigator-bias. Finally, the computationally-minimal workflow required for obtaining measurements makes the method simple to implement in most laboratories.Keywords:Hypertrophy, Fluorescence, Sulforhodamine B, IP3signaling, GPCR, Cell culture, Drug screeningHighlights•Maladaptive hypertrophy of myocytes can lead to heart failure.•Common methods for tracking growth in cultured myocytes are inadequate.•We design and test a method for tracking myocyte hypertrophy in vitro.•The method provides a ratiometric index of growth for high throughput analyses.•Using the method, we characterize further details of (anti)hypertrophic responses.1. IntroductionCardiac myocytes can undergo hypertrophic growth in response to increased work-load. This can be physiological in response to regular exercise or pregnancy, or pathophysiological in conditions of cardiovascular disease such as ischemia, hypertension or cardiomyopathy [1]. Whilst physiological hypertrophy is reversible and leads to enhanced function, pathological hypertrophy can lead to arrhythmias, heart failure and/or sudden death [2,3]. Since hypertrophy is associated with an altered program of gene expression [4], controlled by transcription factors that respond to neuro-hormonal stimuli [[4],[5],[6]], a routine method for investigating pro-hypertrophic cascades is to apply such chemical triggers to myocytes in vivo using delivery devices [[7],[8],[9]], or in vitro by tissue culture methods [10,11].

Each of the many signaling pathways in this network contributes uniquely to the control of cellular adaptation. In the last few years, it has become apparent that multimolecular signaling complexes or ‘signalosomes’ are important for fidelity in intracellular signaling and for mediating crosstalk between the different signaling pathways. These complexes integrate upstream signals and control downstream effectors. In the cardiac myocyte, the protein mAKAPβ serves as a scaffold for a large signalosome that is responsive to cAMP, calcium, hypoxia, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. The main function of mAKAPβ signalosomes is to modulate stress-related gene expression regulated by the transcription factors NFATc, MEF2 and HIF-1α and type II histone deacetylases that control pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Keywords:mAKAP, nuclear envelope, signalosome, heart, remodelingMyocyte hypertrophy is the primary response of the heart to stress (1). While in isolation myocyte hypertrophy can be compensatory for increased wall stress (LaPlace’s Law), this non-mitotic cell growth is typically accompanied in disease by changes in gene expression, ion fluxes and metabolism that can negatively impact cardiac contractility. In addition, pathological remodeling of the heart involves concomitant increased cell death and the development of myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Together, these adaptations contribute to both systolic and diastolic dysfunction that are present in different proportions depending upon the underlying disease (2). Pathological remodeling of the myocyte is regulated by a complex intracellular signaling network that includes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclic nucleotide, Ca2+, hypoxia, and phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathways (3). Although much progress has been made in defining the components of this network, it is still unclear how the various member pathways act in concert to regulate overall cellular phenotype (4). The formation of multimolecular enzyme complexes by scaffold proteins is an important mechanism responsible for specificity and integration in intracellular signal transduction (5). Many signaling enzymes have broad substrate specificity or are present at low concentrations within the cell. The co-localization of an enzyme with its substrate by a scaffold protein can selectively enhance the modification of that substrate, providing specificity and efficacy beyond that intrinsic to the enzyme’s active site (6). In addition, by binding a multivalent scaffold, a substrate may be co-regulated by the appropriate combination of enzymes responsible for determining specific downstream functions (7). Work over the last 15 years has established the scaffold protein muscle A-kinase anchoring protein β (m"
